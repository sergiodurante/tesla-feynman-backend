Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 10 of 339 
Introduction 
Progress in digital and industrial technologies, including in space, shapes all sectors of the 
economy and society. These technologies transform the way industry develops, create new 
products and services, and are central to any sustainable future. Research and innovation to 
support the green and digital transition, and attain and maintain strategic capacities such 
Access to Space or Act in Space, are a key to Europe’s competitiveness and open strategic 
autonomy, to industrial sustainability and to setting human-centred standards. 
Resilience and technological sovereignty have become renewed priorities for the EU due to 
the current geopolitical and economic context that exposed vulnerabilities in critical value 
chains. In this context it is imperative to contribute to the implementation of the Net-Zero 
Industry Act (NZIA) and the Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA); and to reinforce 
Europe’s position in digital technologies, high-performance computing, Artificial Intelligence, 
robotics, secure communication, virtual worlds, critical Space technologies, advanced and 
sustainable manufacturing technologies, net-zero industry, sustainable raw and innovative 
materials, and the circular economy. 
Cluster 4, ‘Digital, Industry and Space’ aims to shape competitive and trusted technologies for 
EU leadership in these technologies; to enable production and consumption respecting the 
boundaries of our planet; and to maximise the benefits for all parts of society in the variety of 
social, economic and territorial contexts in Europe. It will for example boost Europe 
leadership and competitiveness on Artificial Intelligence innovation (AI), leading the way on 
making AI safer and more trustworthy, and on tackling the risks stemming from its misuse. 
Similarly, it will ease the exploitation of untapped data potential while promoting high 
standards of data protection. 
This cluster will serve the goals of the Competitiveness Compass through substantial R&I 
investments, often complemented by private investments through partnerships, across 
different technology readiness levels; and by integrating technological, environmental and 
social objectives into innovation. 
This cluster will also support the Clean Industrial Deal, by driving decarbonisation and 
circularity in the manufacturing, energy-intensive and construction industries; and by 
providing the advanced materials and advanced manufacturing technologies that are needed 
for a net-zero economy. It aims to position the European Union as a technology and industrial 
leader in clean technologies. 
Actions under this cluster will support key enabling technologies that are strategically

Destinations 
Destination 1: Achieving global leadership in climate-neutral, circular and digitised 
industrial and digital value chains 
The research and innovation under this Destination will continue to support a globally 
competitive European industry through the twin green and digital transition. The 
development of new and cross-cutting technologies will boost the transformation of existing 
value chains and the creation of new ones.  
Supporting net-zero manufacturing is a key objective of the Net-Zero Industry Act and has a 
crucial role to play in the transition towards a green and sustainable society, going from 
‘smart factory’ to a ‘smart sustainable value chain’. Smart manufacturing will help develop 
the materials and products needed to support net-zero and less polluting industries. There is 
much scope for improvement in circularity technologies applicable to different value chains, 
with 
special 
attention 
needed 
for 
product 
design, 
re-use, 
disassembly, 
remanufacturing/upgrading, recycling, and ‘Zero-X’ – zero defects, zero breakdowns and zero 
waste.  
Digital technologies, like big data, advanced computing, and networking (including quantum), 
AI, robotics, photonics and the industrial virtual worlds will transform the practices of 
research, design and engineering, with better performing net-zero solutions and increased 
productivity in all sectors. Quick-response services can support hyperflexible production 
using, e.g. trustworthy AI and digital twins, with digitally enabled certification and 
qualification of processes and products.  
In addition to decarbonisation, energy-intensive industries need to embrace the circular 
economy as a key pillar in the design of their value chains. This will be fundamental to their 
resource efficiency (in terms of materials, energy and water). Particularly important in this 
context is the innovative upcycling of secondary raw materials and waste and the 
development of sustainable and resource-efficient industrial processes.  
The EU has set an ambitious goal for Europe to become the first climate-neutral continent by 
2050. In some areas the key solutions for achieving significant reductions in emissions are 
already in the market. In crucial parts of the economy, as is the case for energy-intensive 
industries, many of the tools needed for such a significant reduction are still at an earlier stage 
of industrial or commercial development. 
Further development and deployment of technologies identified in the ERA (European 
Research Area) industrial technology roadmaps for circular technologies and for low-carbon 
technologies will be essential to achieve this goal. Manufacturing processes, supply chains, 
cyber-physical systems or cities will become more climate neutral and less polluting, and 
circular solutions will include AI and digital twins, and the deployment of common European 
data spaces like those under the Digital Europe Programme.  

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 29 of 339 
Across industries, the human dimension (including gender differences) will be stressed via the 
Industry 5.0 paradigm. 
To successfully move from innovation to deployment, a more effective transfer from small-
scale industrial demonstrators to first-of-a-kind climate-neutral demonstrators is needed.  
Business cases and exploitation strategies for industrialisation: 
This section applies only to those topics in this Destination, for which proposals should 
demonstrate the expected outcomes by including a business case and exploitation strategy for 
industrialisation. 
A business case and a credible initial exploitation strategy are essential components in the 
ultimate success of an industry-based project, as well as its prospects to attract further 
investments for deployment. They will both be decisive factors under the impact criterion, and 
proposers are encouraged to use the extended page limit to present a carefully considered 
business case and exploitation strategy, backed by the management of the companies 
involved. 
The business case should demonstrate the expected impact of the proposal in terms of 
enhanced market opportunities for the participants and deployment in the EU, in the short to 
medium term. It should describe the targeted market(s); estimated market size in the EU and 
globally; user and customer needs; and demonstrate that the solutions will match the market 
and user needs in a cost-effective manner; and describe the expected market position and 
competitive advantage. 
The exploitation strategy should identify obstacles, requirements and necessary actions 
involved in reaching higher TRLs (Technology Readiness Levels), for example: securing the 
required investments, including through possible synergies with other programmes; accessing 
the required skills; matching value chains; enhancing product robustness; securing industrial 
integrators; and user acceptance. 
For TRLs 6 and 7, a credible strategy to achieve future full-scale deployment in the EU is 
expected, indicating the intentions of the industrial partners after the end of the project. 
Where relevant, in the context of skills, it is recommended to develop training material to 
endow workers with the right skillset in order to support the uptake and deployment of new 
innovative products, services, and processes developed in the different projects. This material 
should be tested and be scalable, and can potentially be up-scaled through the European 
Social Fund Plus (ESF+). This will help the European labour force to close the skill gaps in 
the relevant sectors and occupational groups and improve employment and social levels 
across the EU and associated countries. 
For topics in this destination, consortia (if selected for funding) could consider voluntary 
contributions in terms of data, indicators and knowledge to relevant Joint Research 
Centre (JRC) platforms for capitalising the knowledge developed in their projects and 
become more policy relevant:

in part B of the General Annexes is exceptionally extended by 
3 pages. 
 
Expected Outcome: The manufacturing industry should benefit from the following outcomes: 
• Enable an industrial ecosystem13 to double the volume of remanufactured components in 
the Union, compared to 2021, for the sectors and products considered; 
• Stimulate new synergies for circularity in manufacturing industries; 
 
13 
notably ecosystems acknowledged under the European Industrial Strategies 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 31 of 339 
• Increase significantly the capability in Europe to implement remanufacturing 
technologies for retaining, reusing, upgrading or adapting the function of products and 
components; 
• Support skills and education capabilities for remanufacturing; and 
• Support the development or revision of standards to better support remanufacturing.  
These outcomes are also expected to benefit downstream applications in the net-zero 
industries.  
Scope: Remanufacturing (including de-manufacturing) is the rebuilding of products using 
combinations of reused, repaired and new components. Remanufacturing aims to retain the 
usefulness of both products and components and is an essential step in achieving full 
industrial circularity. Ultimately, remanufacturing is expected to reduce the level of resource 
consumption, as well as the carbon footprint of products and logistic chains. Such approaches 
will strengthen industrial resilience by building up a remanufacturing capacity in Europe, 
including possible applications in net-zero technologies and components. 
Proposals should demonstrate cutting-edge remanufacturing approaches, covering de-
manufacturing 
and 
appropriate 
manufacturing 
technologies, 
model-based 
systems 
engineering, quality control and business models. Repurposing of products (at the level of 
systems or components) may also be considered. This approach calls for remanufacturing 
technologies at the factory level, as well as for their integration into circular value loops – 
within specific industrial sectors or across industrial sectors. In general, the approaches should 
integrate traditional manufacturing processes, such as additive manufacturing, machining and 
welding, with automation, robotics and digitalisation. 
Recycling technologies for the generation of secondary raw materials are not within the scope 
of this topic. 
Proposals should address all of the following: 
• Remanufacturing technologies and processes and/or system engineering, building on 
advances in data sharing and AI; 
• Mass de-manufacturing, such as disassembly, separation and sorting; 
• Capability to produce high-quality products from a wide range of resources (new and 
remanufactured components and materials); 
• Methodologies to facilitate decisions made at the end-of-use or end-of-life phase at the 
level of components or systems; 
• Measurement, verification and inspection approaches assuring high quality, traceability 
and compliance with quality standards; 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 32 of 339 
• Stringent data sourcing, interoperability and processing, coupled to robust AI 
technologies (leveraging on existing ontologies and through the implementation of the 
FAIR data principles14); 
• International standards, building on existing standards or contributing to future 
standardisation, with a focus on remanufacturing standards; and 
• New sets of skills required for remanufacturing implementation at the European level.  
Proposals aiming to develop new products should additionally cover the design of these 
products for circularity. Points to consider in this case are prioritising the use of recyclable 
materials and recyclable or reusable components; and increased adaptability, exchangeability 
and lifetime of components. 
Proposals should consider where relevant 
• The EU regulatory framework, notably the Ecodesign for Sustainable Product 
Regulation15 and the EU waste/sectoral legislation16; 
• The Ecodesign approach, especially the circular-by-design approach including 
modularity, repairability, adaptability and exchangeability of components as well as 
refurbishment and repurposing of products or components; and 
• The Digital Product Passport: information about products along their overall lifecycle 
needs to be collected along the remanufacturing operations.  
Proposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the 
introduction to this Destination. It is essential that the business model address the entire 
lifecycle of remanufacturing, including logistics. They should assess the circularity and 
decarbonisation that can be achieved, as well as the economic case and competitiveness, and 
make a corresponding contribution to the standardisation of lifecycle performance metrics. 
Regarding decarbonisation, proposals should address the expected reductions in energy 
consumption and GHG emissions, and – where applicable – impact net-zero technologies and 
components. 
Where relevant, proposals are encouraged to build on, or seek collaboration with, existing 
projects and develop synergies with other relevant European, national or regional initiatives 
and funding programmes. In particular, links are encouraged with 
• the projects funded under earlier relevant topics, for example the topic on re-
manufacturing, HORIZON-CL4-2023-TWIN-TRANSITION-01-04: Factory-level and 
value chain approaches for remanufacturing; or 
• the Digital Europe programme, e.g. in the area of Manufacturing Data Spaces.

Expected Outcome: Manufacturing industry should benefit from the following outcomes: 
• Empower workers at all levels in factories, both individuals and teams, through 
breakthrough augmentation technologies embodying the next stage in human-machine 
interactions; 
• Enhance, with the help of these technologies and related contributions from Social 
Sciences and Humanities (SSH), the flexibility, inclusiveness, safety and well-being of 
workers in the industrial environment, leading to more attractive jobs in the EU, 
attracting and retaining talents from new generations (e.g. Generation Z); 
• Foster the human-centric aspect of the Industry 5.0 model, through insights into how 
technology affects the working environment and the organisation, and into how 
technology can support the worker in their career (including the associated meaningful 
job profiles).  
Scope: The rising complexity of discrete manufacturing operations requires workers to adapt 
to the introduction of new breakthrough technologies, machines, processes, and production 
environments (considering where appropriate legacy machinery). In addition, labour shortages 
are growing. The development of a human-centric culture that places the humans at the centre 
of the manufacturing operation is crucial. Augmentation technologies support and empower 
the workforce, leading to more high-quality jobs and prosperity beyond efficiency. They can 
relieve people of non-creative tasks or reduce human strain and stress and potential risks in 
the workplace. Augmentation technologies can therefore produce benefits for both workers 
and managers and can become the most effective ways of supporting, or amplifying, human 
abilities. 
Proposals should develop breakthrough technologies to augment human capabilities and 
skills. Proposals should cover all of the following aspects: 
• Develop breakthrough solutions (based on e.g. mechatronics, sensing and photonics) for 
human-centric approaches; these include innovative perception technologies to sense the 
shopfloor environment and to predict the intentions of humans, also leading to enhanced 
worker safety and reduction of discomfort, fatigue and physical and psychological stress; 
• Develop innovative methodologies, potentially using AI, to provide reasoning 
capabilities and to control the behaviour of the manufacturing systems, to support 
humans and to interact and communicate with them; this will foster natural 
improvements in efficiency, sharing of knowledge, inclusiveness, accessibility and 
flexibility; 
• Assess and take into account the needs of managers and workers, at the beginning of the 
design phase and throughout all stages up to the development of a prototype, ensuring 
that both workers and managers have the right skills to implement the innovative 
solutions and that the solutions take into account the variety of workforces; 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 35 of 339 
• Develop new methodologies to perform an assessment of augmentation technologies and 
their suitability and value added (beyond economics) for workers in all their diversity.   
Digital-twin models can be potentially used in the development of new assessment 
methodologies to perform validation in a virtual scenario. 
The assessment methodologies may lead to new standards for the validation of the developed 
systems, or indicate how new or existing standards could benefit from a human-centric 
approach and how the developed systems could support this. 
Proposals should take into account Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) contributions 
regarding human-related barriers for the uptake of augmentation technologies in industrial 
environments, such as ergonomics, user experience, comfort, trust, feeling of safety, 
knowledge sharing and liability in modern production facilities. Proposals should specifically 
address gender, age, disability and other anthropometric and ergonomic considerations, and 
impacts across diverse demographic groups. Social partners (e.g. trade unions) may also be 
considered. Optionally, proposals may include test and experimentation environments such as 
living labs for validation. 
Proposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the 
introduction to this Destination (adapted to the expected TRL of this topic). 
This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership Made in Europe.

• Enhanced capabilities in the areas of strategic and high-value-added products for the net-
zero industry; and 
• Increased production capacity for clean technologies in the Member States and 
Associated Countries, diversifying supply sources, and ensuring high environmental 
standards. 
• Contributions to reaching the targets set by the Net Zero Industry Act, in ensuring the 
reduction of strategic dependencies.  
Scope: The net-zero industry relies on manufactured products, components and equipment. 
The focus is on advanced discrete manufacturing processes for such products, components 
and equipment, which enable new product features (in terms of geometry, weight, robustness, 
functional integration, re-use-potential); advanced production processes including automation; 
or the use of innovative materials. The processes should improve productivity and upscaling, 
decrease waste, and shorten time-to-market and process integration times. 
Proposals should address manufacturing technologies applicable to products for at least one 
of the strategic net-zero technologies listed in Annex I of the Net-Zero Industry Act:18 
Proposals should address the key manufacturing technologies that generate cross-sectoral 
impact among the chosen net-zero technology sectors. 
While operating in synergy with initiatives that focus on the design and engineering of 
strategic products and solutions, research and innovation should focus on the innovative 
development and application of one or more of the following manufacturing technologies and 
associated systems: 
• Additive manufacturing or cladding for manufacturing and/or repair; 
• Advanced joining technologies; 
• Advanced forming and material shaping technologies; 
• Surface processing technologies, functionalisation, nano- or micromanufacturing; and 
• High-precision machining and assembly.  
Proposals should consider integrating 
• Innovative metrology and inspection methods, aiming at first-time right manufacturing;

• Advanced and flexible automation approaches, for instance for large components, 
complex assembling or handling of hazardous materials; 
• Digital twins and data mining for fast ramp-up, scale-up and real-time optimisation of 
production; 
• Circular manufacturing approaches and reduced reliance on Critical Raw Materials, in 
view of increasing the options for re-manufacturing, disassembly, recycling, etc.; and 
• Relevant skills and standards.  
In addition the overall environmental impact of the manufacturing processes should be 
minimal in terms of energy and resource consumption and CO2 emissions.

dealing with packaging of products and other consumables related to the construction works; 
temporary accommodation for workers; temporary utility connections and associated works; 
planning of works; coordination of trades and operations, including machines as well as 
human workers. Mistakes and delays in construction works can lead to negative consequences 
such as risk of accidents, waste, pollution, inefficiency and financial consequences. 
Construction works need to be carried out more quickly and efficiently, with less room for 
error and waste. This could be improved through technology-driven innovations linked to on-
site operations and logistical aspects. 
Proposals should: 
• Develop technologies that improve the efficiency of operations on the construction site, 
leading to more productive, faster and more efficient working practices. The 
technologies should be interoperable with, or build upon existing industry-wide 
practices, such as Digital Twins and Building Information Modelling tools. Speed and 
efficiency improvements should not be at the expense of safety. 
• Address the traceability of construction products and other items delivered to the site, 
installed on site, and removed. If relevant, this can also include coordination with other 
operations outside the construction site boundary. 
• Integrate circular economy approaches, such as waste prevention and the management 
and recovery of construction and demolition waste; 
• Address new ways for site operations to reduce the chances of errors and 
accidents/taking better account of unexpected disruptions; 
• Address human-centric and Social Science and Humanities (SSH) aspects of 
technologies or tools that are developed. Take into consideration potential social 
innovation mechanisms that can facilitate the market uptake of the developed tools.  
Proposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the 
introduction to this Destination. 
Proposals may choose to contribute to relevant European standardisation efforts. Proposals 
should seek to build synergies with relevant other work, for example, EU-funded projects 
under the New European Bauhaus Facility, or Horizon Europe partnerships including 
Built4People.

Expected Outcome: Energy Intensive industries will benefit from the following outcomes: 
• Enable the integration of renewable electricity in the process industries by transitioning 
from heat driven to direct electricity driven process units in a plant; 
• Contribute to achieving the EU climate neutrality objective as well as proposed 2040 
90% GHG reduction target20;

Technologies; 
• Improve the economic viability of the entire unit compared to the state-of-the-art heat-
driven process and increase the competitiveness and resilience of the European process 
industry.   
Scope: The generation of heat, which is often sourced from fossil fuel combustion, is the 
biggest consumer of energy in the process industries and responsible for 60% of process 
industries GHG emissions. Heat input is in particular commonly used in separation and drying 
processes. The topic focuses on the development of new electrically driven industrial 
processes where heat input in such processes is replaced by electro-mechanical power or other

forms of direct electrical input. These electrified processes could represent a major reduction 
of GHG emissions as well as an important source of energy savings. The scope does not 
include conventional electric heating or the use of heat pumps. 
Proposals under this topic should address all of the following: 
• Demonstrate and/or integrate highly efficient electrically driven technologies e.g., 
membrane technology, power ultrasound, mechanical activation, mechanically or 
electricity induced forces, electrochemical processes, that can replace traditional heating 
processes; 
• Demonstrate and evaluate energy efficiency gains; 
• Prove the effectiveness of the technologies towards GHG emission avoidance; 
• Take a holistic approach which may include aspects such as redesign of equipment, 
requirements for advanced materials and integrated electrified processes; 
• Ensure process safety, sufficient flexibility and ease of process control; 
• Showcase improved CO2 reduction potential, performance, scalability and cost 
efficiency of the proposed solution through, at least, one realistic use case that can be 
replicable with demonstrable economic return.  
The inclusion of a GHG avoidance methodology 21 is recommended and should provide 
detailed descriptions of baselines and projected emissions reduction. 
Proposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy, 
as outlined in the introduction to this Destination, underlining how the proposal will serve the 
purpose to boost industrial decarbonisation technologies supply chain in Europe. As project 
output an elaborated exploitation plan should be developed, including preliminary plans for 
scalability, commercialisation and deployment (feasibility study, business plan and financial 
model) indicating possible private and public funding sources (e.g. Innovation Fund, 
InvestEU and cohesion policy funds). Societal- and environmental impact as well as 
implications for the workplace (including skills and organisational change) should be 
outlined.

Expected Outcome: Energy Intensive industries will benefit from the following outcomes: 
• Increase significantly the process flexibility offering a step change in the capacity of 
individual production plants to promptly and frequently adapt to energy input variations 
over a significant range and with increased speed; 
• Enable new flexible and efficient production processes, leading to economic and 
sustainability gains despite of volatile energy supply variations; 
• Increase significantly raw material and energy efficiency while facing variations of the 
renewable energy input when compared to state-of-the-art industrial processes; 
• Contribute to achieving EU climate neutrality objective as well as Commission 
recommendation of reducing EU GHG emissions by 90% by 2040 22.   
Scope: Flexibility of energy intensive production processes is a necessity for the use of 
alternative energy carriers as the supply of energy by renewable sources is subject to 
significant variations and the competitive potential of energy storage is limited. The optimal 
use of the renewable energy supply will require processes that can perform fast transitions to 
allow continuous and efficient operation when the renewable energy input varies. The limiting 
factor addressed by the topic is the ability of the production plants to promptly change loads 
and throughputs in large ranges without negative consequences for the equipment, while 
staying energy and resource efficient. Storage options and use of several sources of renewable 
energy can be included, the combination (hybridation) of various decarbonisation 
technologies can also be considered.

Expected Outcome: Energy Intensive industries will benefit from the following outcomes: 
• Enable the integrated use of different types of renewable energy carriers in industrial 
sites24 with the aim to provide a constant robust low-carbon and economic energy input 
to process industries;

heat, ammonia, etc) which can be utilised in the process industries. Many of them are 
provided with significant temporal variations, e.g., renewable electricity and solar heat. 
Integrated design and operation of these highly complex systems within process industry sites 
are needed to cope with the fluctuations of the energy inputs and to achieve overall energy

Expected Outcome: Manufactures of net zero technology solutions, as well as energy 
intensive industries will benefit from the following outcomes: 
•  Enable the sustainable and efficient use of energy in the energy intensive industries by 
bridging the gap between users and manufacturers of net-zero solutions for the energy-
intensive industries. 
• Foster win-win situations in which equipment manufactures co-create solutions with the 
energy-intensive industrial sectors opening new markets for the net-zero technologies; 
• Develop new net-zero technologies industrially integrated processes that support the 
decarbonization of industry and offer new market opportunities;

• Enhance competitiveness of the European Energy Intensive and manufacturing 
industries; 
• Accelerate the adoption of net-zero technologies in the energy intensive industries.   
Scope: As the industry decarbonises net-zero technologies27 can be applied to a wide range of 
energy intensive sectors and processes. Furthermore, the Net-Zero Industry Act which is part 
of the Green Deal Industrial Plan, is aiming at increasing the manufacturing capacity of 
strategic net-zero technologies to meet at least 40% of the EU’s annual deployment needs. In 
this framework the aim of this topic is to accelerate the deployment of net-zero technologies 
in at least one industrial sectors through a closer collaboration between, net-zero technology 
manufacturers and energy intensive industries. 
Proposals under this topic should address several of the following: 
• Facilitate collaboration between at least one energy intensive industrial sector, with 
manufacturers of net-zero technology solutions, as well as where relevant engineering, 
and construction firms for the smart integration of one or several net-zero technologies 
in specific processes. Several energy intensive industrial sectors can be considered if 
they share similar processes and energy related needs; 
• Assess the needs of the proposed industrial sector(s) to define ‘standard’ process(es) and 
assess operational energy needs through a closer exchange with net-zero technology 
manufacturers and suppliers in order to effectively design sustainable and cost-efficient 
energy solutions; 
• Optimise and adapt technologies, products and solutions proposed by manufacturers of 
net zero technologies to meet the industrial sector needs; 
• Propose and demonstrate the necessary modifications of processes for the efficient and 
flexible incorporation and the integration of net zero technologies in existing industrial 
plants; 
• Demonstrate the effectiveness and replicability of the proposed approaches allowing to 
move from custom-built project by project approach for each specific industrial plant 
and process, to more streamlined, standardised yet flexible solution for industrial 
sector(s) and/or processes; 
• Develop solutions offering an optimal balance between standardisation and flexibility as 
well as providing high-quality tailored solutions at competitive prices; 
• Support the development of skills for the integration of net-zero technologies into energy 
intensive industries.

Expected Outcome: The topic enables a fast and reliable transition to innovative technology 
pathways for carbon-neutral iron and steel making by tackling fundamental problems and 
boundary conditions with a system-level approach. This approach will target input materials, 
processes, and iron /steel output quality, considering the needs to reduce production costs, 
find alternative materials and solutions, improve process/energy efficiency and achieve at 
least the traditional product quality. 
Iron and steel making plants constitute complex systems where the product quality is bound to 
a large set of variables. Variations in feedstock composition, along with reductant choice and 
mix, introduce noticeable variations in process metallurgy, its kinetics and thermodynamics, 
with influence on the morphology of the intermediates and consequent impact on the next 
phases of production, and lifetime, quality, safety and reliability of the finished product. 
The strong dependence of the final steel quality on the variable quality of the raw materials 
and the balance of the production process, has to be taken into account under the 
consideration of costs, energy availability, sustainability, overall and specific energy 
efficiency, CO2 emissions and strategic resources (in particular strategic raw materials29). 
Projects are expected to contribute to at least three of the following outcomes: 
• Validate innovative carbon-neutral iron and steel making solutions within a system-level 
approach and in consideration of diverse materials with varying quality (raw input

• Provide an impact analysis covering the materials and energy balance of identified 
solutions, viability and byproducts.  
Scope: The topic calls for collaborative approach between academia, industry (including 
SMEs) and research organizations with the purpose to support: i) understanding, validating, 
and solving essential problems to allow maturity of innovative technologies in the industrial 
investment panorama for future carbon-neutral iron and steel making, ii) accelerating a 
reliable transition to climate neutrality in view of the end of the free ETS allowances by 
providing solutions optimized for different scenarios, and iii) fulfilling the Commission 
Recommendation 2024/77430 on a Code of Practice on industry-academia co-creation for 
knowledge valorisation. 
Proposals should address at least four of the following points: 
• De-risk and extend operational windows of low CO2 iron- and steel making technologies 
considering system-level scenarios; 
• Target the heterogeneity of available reductants and feedstock materials, their different 
physical states and the mixed use of them. In this context, the sustainability of the 
process to produce them should be considered, along with the requirements for various 
grades of purity; 
• Achieve high-quality steel products characterized by increased tolerances of contents of 
contaminants, originating from low quality raw materials. Adapt the micro-structure and 
control application-specific properties by acting on material preparation, processes and 
process technologies. Include the development of detection / measurement systems and 
multi-scale models as needed; 
• Analyse, micro- and/or nano-characterise, and compare low-carbon production of liquid 
iron and/or crude steel combining the use of direct reduced iron (DRI) with varying 
qualities and raw materials from primary and secondary sources to push for closing 
material cycles; 
• Couple the analysis with needs for plant design optimisation and measures to mitigate 
risks during operation; 
• Define pre-processing needs of primary and secondary iron containing materials for iron 
and steelmaking targeting low environmental impact. Analyse the effects on the 
production process and product metallurgy; 
• Consider analytical research infrastructures. Data should be supporting simulations- and 
modelling needs in line with FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and 
Reusability) principles. Interoperability of data sharing should be addressed;

• Consider effects of solutions indicated in the outcomes of the proposed project on 
specific regional or country level conditions, including cross-sectorial scenarios, such as 
energy availability, water use and recovery of water and other resources from the 
steelmaking process to use in other industrial sectors and vice versa, where applicable; 
• Use tools such as, but not limited to, life cycle assessment (LCA) or life cycle costing 
(LCC) to create benchmarks for progress measurement towards carbon neutrality; 
• Aim at taking advantage of pilot plants in Europe to create correlations between real-
world processes and laboratory-based research.  
Multidisciplinary research activities should address at least one of the following: 
• Introduce sensors or develop new ones, especially able to work in very high temperature 
environments. They may include a soft and integrated set of sensors. Use fast digital 
techniques for data collection, processing and analysis. Develop enhanced models with 
different levels of resolution and integrate Machine Learning (ML)/AI for 
comprehensive understanding of process mechanisms; 
• Use input from finalised/ongoing research in heat recovery via heat exchange 
technologies that could contribute to reduction of external energy use; 
• Develop concepts for on-site hydrogen production techniques at very low cost.

Expected Outcome: Energy Intensive industries will benefit from the following outcomes: 
• Prove the technical, economic, and environmental feasibility of the upcycling of end-of-
life waste materials by process industries in integrated circular schemes – including for 
supplying the value chains of net zero technologies and components; 
• Enable doubling the ratio of secondary raw materials upcycled leading to a significant 
increase in resource, including energy efficiency and improved carbon lifecycle across 
the value chain compared to present levels; 
• Increase the competitiveness of the European process industry, including by providing 
new business opportunities and revenue flows for recycling companies benefiting 
particularly SMEs – including for supplying the value chains of net zero technologies 
and components; 
• Foster the use of digital tools as well as the data sharing, and FAIR (Findability, 
Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability) digital assets principles. 
• As appropriate in one or more projects, contribute to the reconstruction, recovery, 
circularity and upgrading of industries of Ukraine.  
Scope: The recycling of end-of-life materials into valuable materials that can replace primary 
raw materials requires integrated systems from the collection to dismantling and separation to 
their final processing. The technologies and implementation (including logistics and 
economics) of such circular schemes should be addressed in an integrated way. The 
innovation needed will depend on the addressed waste category. However, even if the 
upcycling technologies and implementation may be sector/material specific, the cross-
sectorial elements are important and should deserve due attention. 
Proposals are expected to address all of the following:

• Reduce the use of hazardous substances in production processes and materials that pose 
a risk for human- and environmental health and safety, and ensure the avoidance of their 
proliferation into products; 
• Enable novel processing technologies and materials with reduced health, safety, and 
environmental impacts; 
• Increased knowledge on the industrial emission releases when it comes to emerging and 
less known groups of hazardous pollutants not regulated at EU level; 
• Reduce the occupational exposure risk and negative health impacts at work by 
empowering employees; 
• Contribute to the clean air and potentially biodiversity objectives, through the outcomes 
above.  
Scope: Whereas the release of pollutants by European industry has generally decreased during 
the last decade, and it is expected to continue to do so, industry still contributes significantly 
to the emission of many pollutants into the European environment. Pollution harms our health 
and our environment. In addition to affecting people’s health, pollution is one of the main 
reasons for the loss of biodiversity. Moreover, only emissions of historically important 
pollutants are reported by industry. Information on emerging and less known pollutants, 
especially those not regulated by the Industrial Emissions Directive, and related methods of 
monitoring is lacking. GHG emissions from industry are not included in the scope of this 
topic. Pollutant emissions to air, water and soil are considered. 
Proposals under this topic should address all of the following: 
• Demonstrate the reduction of the use of hazardous substances that pose a risk for human- 
and environmental health and safety and thereby also their proliferation into the 
products; 
• Develop novel processing technologies leading to reduced health, safety and 
environmental impacts beyond CO2 emissions; 
• Minimise adverse effects from the novel processes’ technologies on the function and 
durability of the materials, recyclability, the production cost as well as the associated 
risk; 
• Where relevant, develop sampling and monitoring methods for emerging pollutants and 
less known groups of pollutants in stack emissions before entering the environment.  
Proposals should include techno-economic and life-cycle assessment considerations of the 
overall process. They should consider involving all the relevant actors in a participatory 
approach for the reduction of risk and health issues at work.

Expected Outcome: Social Circular Enterprises (SCEs)42 need to adapt to new market realities 
in the circular economy, driven by the search for new market opportunities (e.g. secondary 
raw materials market, business models addressing change in consumption awareness, and 
technological developments improving productivity). To achieve this adaptation, investment 
in R&D capacity and technology for SCEs is essential. Besides further developing its offer 
towards consumers, SCEs are increasingly focussing their activities towards B2B markets, 
such as for secondary raw materials. In that regard, SCEs started to explore the growing and 
labour-intensive market of sorting, recycling and upcycling services for other businesses. 
Research and innovation can accelerate this potential and is most needed in the area to remain 
competitive. Moreover, research and innovation in this sector can lever potentials beyond 
productivity and competitiveness, as SCEs pursue a triple impact: economic, green (contribute 
to a circular and resource efficient economy) and social (employment of vulnerable groups). 
The following outcomes are expected for SCEs and wider circular networks: 
• Improve the uptake and scale of technology solutions in individual SCE and promote 
shared technology development and engineering through SCE clusters. 
• Improve competitiveness through enhanced productivity, as well as new market 
opportunities, for SCEs related to specific waste streams with potential for competitive

advantages, such as, textiles, WEEE (waste electrical and electronic equipment) and 
construction materials; 
• Prove technical, economic, and environmental excellence of SCE in (local) circular 
value chains (e.g. I-US) leading to increased collaboration with (mainstream / for profit) 
industrial partners; 
• Contribute to the reduction of non-recyclable waste generated in the region/area of the 
cluster by contributing to the re-using and transforming waste, by-products, and side-
streams into new/secondary resources of raw materials; 
• Increase employment of persons with a distance to the labour market in SCE and 
improve their labour productivity, for example by using assistive technology in the work 
process and use of data (e.g. AI trained assessment and instructions).  
Scope: Social Circular Enterprises (SCEs) have been pioneers in the circular economy since 
decades. They are active in all stages of the circular economy and deal with various waste 
stream. SCEs are also known to offer new and innovative circular business models and 
brining new circular services and products to the market. In the last decade SCE also entered 
the market of secondary raw materials by collecting and dissembling various products and 
goods. The majority of SCEs are SMEs and offer local employment opportunities to 
vulnerable groups (99%)43. On average, a circular social enterprise creates 70 jobs per 1,000 
tons collected with a view of being re-used. 
Projects are expected to research and develop a replicable tech-oriented demonstrator(s) 
within social circular clusters. Within a demonstrator, partners are expected to jointly adapt, 
design, test and implement relevant technology solutions. The following specific activities are 
expected within demonstrators: 
• The demonstrators are supposed to organise as a Social Circular Tech Cluster allowing 
to pool resources and adapt, develop and test technology solutions. This will facilitate 
more business opportunities (tech based spin-offs) and sharing of expertise with relevant 
industries. 
• A demonstrator consortium should be active in at least two Member States or Associated 
Countries and can choose to focus on textile and construction waste or WEEE. Each 
demonstrator consortium exists out of two or more clusters, each grouping individual 
SCEs (ideally with different degrees of maturity44), for-profit circular companies (e.g. 
sectoral peers in secondary raw materials industries), research, and tech centres able to 
support SCE with relevant technology and research capacity. SCEs should form the core 
of the consortia, and should benefit directly from the interventions to improve their triple 
impact model. Public authorities and SCE federations could engage where appropriate. 
Demonstrator consortia should to be transnational in order to compare pilots in different 
markets.

• Adapting, designing and developing technologies in SCEs needs should focus on 
optimising efficiency45 in management and processing of waste streams and enlarge the 
potential market activity of SCEs in the circular economy (WEEE, textiles and 
construction focus). Relevant technologies should improve the productivity and 
innovation capacity within SCE and consequently the market position in the secondary 
raw materials markets. Technologies can include data driven technologies such as AI to 
improve sorting knowledge and decision making (screening based on automated 
recognition with cost-benefit analysis), software to standardise repair operations and 
instructions, improve stocks management and increase reuse sales by optimising the 
pricing system (e.g. automated value calculation of incoming materials and goods), 
digital modelling tools (including material passport), etc. 
• Research could also include the potential of assistive technologies to support employees 
(mostly persons with disabilities, specific impairments, or social disadvantages) in SCE 
in order to improve their productivity and wellbeing. 
• Market research focussing on improving the position of SCE as an attractive partner in 
management and processing of waste streams (in terms of textile, WEEE and 
construction materials) with most potential for growth in B2B markets. For example 
focussing on collection, disassembly, sorting, purification, concentration, recycling, 
exchanging or preparation, for the valorisation of waste to be used as feedstock for other 
plants and companies across sectors and/or across value chains. This market research can 
include specific sectoral assessment of economic potential for most labour-intensive 
circular activities. 
• By organising through clusters, demonstrators are motivated to develop shared 
engineering activities (labs, strategies and shared technology) to make technology 
accessible for enterprises with less capacity and resources and to reduce overall costs for 
individual SCEs. 
• Where relevant, proposals are encouraged to build on, or seek collaboration with, 
existing projects and develop synergies with other relevant European, national or 
regional initiatives and funding programmes. In particular, the project could build further 
on relevant knowledge, tools, methods and technology developed and applied within 
existing H4C (Clusters for Circularity) and its knowledge platform.46

Destination 2: Achieving technological leadership for Europe's open strategic autonomy 
in raw materials, chemicals and innovative materials 
The research and innovation under this Destination will contribute to a paradigm shift, as 
regards the availability, development, use and disposal of chemicals and materials. This is 
necessary to guarantee Europe’s technological sovereignty and capacity to deliver on the twin 
green and digital transitions (it is thus strongly linked to the objectives of the Destination 
‘Achieving global leadership in climate-neutral, circular and digitised industrial and digital 
value chains’). 
To enable such a shift, an innovative, strong European R&I ecosystem for circular chemicals 
and materials is needed, working across different technology readiness levels. Bringing 
knowledge and skills together across the materials’ value chains is key to ensuring that this 
shift can materialise. 
The requirements of the European Green Deal for safety, sustainability and circularity should 
be considered across the life cycle of a chemical or material. The 2022 Commission 
Recommendation on ‘Safe and Sustainable by Design’ (SSbD) sets out a new framework on 
how to achieve these objectives. 
R&I activities should contribute to strengthen EU’s critical raw materials capacities along all 
stages of the value chain, increasing our resilience by reducing dependencies, increasing 
preparedness and promoting supply chain sustainability and circularity, in line with the 
Critical Raw Materials Act. It is necessary to improve the energy and process efficiency of 
extractive and processing activities and minimise their environmental impact, including GHG 
emissions. Advancements need to be made on finding options for replacing critical raw 
materials with other (advanced) materials offering at least the same functionality and taking 
into account the existing environmental concerns. 
Advanced materials (including amongst others nano- and 2D materials) and chemicals are 
designed with functionality in mind. Compared to conventional materials, they have novel 
properties that significantly step-up performance. New digital tools are needed such as 
common data spaces, digital twins, industrial virtual worlds, as well as novel (autonomous) 
design, synthesis, development, characterisation and fabrication tools as well as continuous 
training of scientists on these new tools. 
To secure unimpeded market entry, appropriate test methods are needed. New chemicals and 
materials should be developed using the SSbD framework and with the efficiency and 
circularity of materials in mind, also for their inclusion in products. This calls for tools, 
models and data for robust SSbD, including animal-free new approach methodologies and 
systematic life-cycle assessments. Bio-based advanced materials/chemicals and the 
integration and interaction of biological and artificial materials and components offer new 
opportunities to reduce resource dependencies and maintain sustainability. 
Achieving the circularity of both raw materials and advanced materials is a key future 
challenge. Establishing new material flows, recovery, recycling and upcycling of materials

Part 7 - Page 66 of 339 
from waste are challenges in themselves, but they also require information sharing along and 
across value chains and development of new business models allowing to foster innovative 
solutions related to technological progress, such as in materials design. 
Uptake of advanced materials as well as a more efficient use of materials should be fostered 
in product and materials-based technology developments. This also requires new business 
models to be developed for the deployment of circular technologies and value chains as well 
as for providing product-as-a-service models, on-demand manufacturing, take-back-schemes 
and other service-based businesses. Strong support to SMEs is required so they can thrive in 
this materials ecosystem. 
Business cases and exploitation strategies for industrialisation: 
This section applies only to those topics in this Destination, for which proposals should 
demonstrate the expected outcomes by including a business case and exploitation strategy for 
industrialisation. 
A business case and a credible initial exploitation strategy are essential components in the 
ultimate success of an industry-based project, as well as its prospects to attract further 
investments for deployment. They will both be decisive factors under the impact criterion, and 
proposers are encouraged to use the extended page limit to present a carefully considered 
business case and exploitation strategy, backed by the management of the companies 
involved. 
The business case should demonstrate the expected impact of the proposal in terms of 
enhanced market opportunities for the participants and deployment in the EU, in the short to 
medium term. It should describe the targeted market(s); estimated market size in the EU and 
globally; user and customer needs; and demonstrate that the solutions will match the market 
and user needs in a cost-effective manner; and describe the expected market position and 
competitive advantage. 
The exploitation strategy should identify obstacles, requirements and necessary actions 
involved in reaching higher TRLs (Technology Readiness Levels), for example: securing the 
required investments, including through possible synergies with other programmes; accessing 
the required skills; matching value chains; enhancing product robustness; securing industrial 
integrators; and user acceptance. 
For TRLs 6 and 7, a credible strategy to achieve future full-scale deployment in the EU is 
expected, indicating the intentions of the industrial partners after the end of the project. 
Where relevant, in the context of skills, it is recommended to develop training material to 
endow workers with the right skillset in order to support the uptake and deployment of new 
innovative products, services, and processes developed in the different projects. This material 
should be tested and be scalable, and can potentially be up-scaled through the European 
Social Fund Plus (ESF+). This will help the European labour force to close the skill gaps in 
the relevant sectors and occupational groups and improve employment and social levels 
across the EU and associated countries.

Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes: 
• Increased recovery rate of critical and strategic raw materials as set out in the Critical 
Raw Materials Act 51  through developing raw materials recycling and re-use of 
components and/or products from end-of-life (EoL) products, including recovery of raw 
material by-products. 
• Improved competitiveness of secondary raw materials production by enhancing cost 
effectiveness. 
• Improved efficiency of technologies for separation and recycling and the sustainable 
embedment of the process in terms of energy, resource and water use, waste and 
emissions (including Green House Gases and air pollutants) footprint. 
• Improved responsible supply of raw materials to Europe from EoL streams in line with 
the EU principles for sustainable raw materials,52 which are a non-regulatory set of 
principles based on the EU acquis. They set out requirements for sustainable raw 
materials and extraction and processing in Europe in terms of social, environmental and 
economic performance. 
• Actions are expected to contribute to the implementation of the EU Critical Raw 
Materials Act53.  
Scope:  
• Actions should develop material efficient high-quality re-use and recycling of one or 
more of the following end-of-life product categories/key waste streams: waste electrical 
and electronic equipment (WEEE), waste batteries, end-of-life vehicles, waste wind 
turbines, waste solar photovoltaics, waste heat pumps, waste electrolysers and machine 
tools made from high-performance alloys. 
• Actions should focus on the whole chain of re-using and recycling processes and 
procedures – from collection, logistics, characterisation, sorting, cleaning, refining and 
purification of secondary raw materials and quality of produced outputs. 
• Actions should focus on functional re-use and recycling. Recycling where the recycled 
material is of lower functionality than the original material (downcycling) is to be 
avoided.

• Actions are expected to contribute to the implementation of the EU Critical Raw 
Materials Act61.  
Scope: Proposals should: 
• Develop and demonstrate extraction, processing or refining technologies in order to 
facilitate and increase recovery in exploitation of primary critical raw materials 
(minerals and metals only). The proposals have to demonstrate (measure and assess) 
reduced environmental and social impact. Proposals can include additional exploration 
aspects if duly justified. 
• Justify the relevance of all targeted minerals and metals. Priority are the EU critical raw 
materials. Sea mining is not within the scope of this topic. 
• Collaborate with countries with which the EU has signed Strategic Partnerships on Raw 
Materials.62 
• Collaborate with one selected Strategic Partnership country out of the four groups: 
Group 1 (Argentina, Chile), Group 2 (Democratic Republic of the Congo, Namibia, 
Rwanda, Zambia), Group 3 (Kazakhstan, Serbia, Uzbekistan), Group 4 (Australia, 
Greenland). Group 4 can be extended to countries which will sign strategic partnerships 
for raw materials before the deadline for applications. The consortia should include raw 
materials industry from the targeted country in the focussed group, as well as 
downstream users from the EU. Proposals are expected to focus on one out of four 
groups. 
• Demonstrate technology on mineral resources of the targeted partner country. The 
environmental (including GHG and other air pollutant emissions, water, soils, 
biodiversity) and social impacts of technology should be duly measured and assessed. 
• Envisage clustering activities with other relevant selected projects for cross-projects co-
operation, consultations and joint activities on cross-cutting issues and share of results as 
well as participating in joint meetings and communication events. To this end proposals 
should foresee a dedicated work package and/or task, and earmark the appropriate 
resources accordingly. 
• Facilitate the market uptake of solutions developed through industry- and user-driven

• Raw materials for semiconductors competitively produced and refined in the EU in a 
sustainable and socially acceptable way improving the competitiveness of European 
industry. 
• Increase recovery rates of particularly raw materials from low grade or complex ores 
and/or from residues and/or by-products and/or extractive waste and/or manufacturing 
waste. 
• Increase the competitiveness and sustainability of mineral processing and refining 
processes in terms of cost-effectiveness, higher material-, water-, energy-efficiency, 
emission reduction and flexibility. This may also include the development of more 
sustainable solvents, reagents, and low-carbon manufacturing processes. 
• Foster collaboration among industry stakeholders along the value chain, research 
institutions, and technology providers to accelerate the development and adoption of 
sustainable production solutions. 
• Improve responsible supply of raw materials to Europe in line with the EU principles for 
sustainable raw materials69, which are a non-regulatory set of principles based on the EU 
acquis. They set out requirements for sustainable raw materials and extraction and 
processing in Europe in terms of social, environmental, and economic performance.  
Scope: Actions should focus on raw materials for semiconductors necessary for the green and 
digital transition and strategic sectors, such as for example aero-space; including one or more 
of the following raw materials: antimony, arsenic, bismuth, boron, gallium, germanium, 
indium, selenium, silicon, tellurium. 
Actions should facilitate the market uptake of solutions developed through industrially- and 
user-driven multidisciplinary consortia covering the relevant value chain from extraction to 
the production of semiconductor grade raw materials and alloys, as well as relevant 
downstream industry. Standardisation aspects should be considered when relevant. 
Proposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy, 
as outlined in the introduction to this Destination. For TRLs 6-7, a credible strategy to achieve 
future full-scale deployment in the EU and encourage long-term industrial collaboration is 
expected, indicating the intentions of the industrial partners after the end of the project. 
Actions should envisage clustering activities with other relevant selected projects for cross 
projects co-operation, consultations and joint activities on cross-cutting issues and share of

Scope:  
• The objective of the European Partnership on Raw Materials is to strengthen the co-
ordination of national and regional research programmes in the field of non-energy and 
non-agricultural raw materials, ensuring common understanding of R&I challenges to 
achieve the objectives of the Critical Raw Materials Act79. 
• The Partnership will build on the experience of ERA-NETs: ERA-MIN, ERA-MIN 2 
and ERA-MIN 3. The Partnership should cover the whole raw materials value chain 
including exploration, extraction, processing technologies, and recycling and improve 
circularity. Sea mining is excluded from this topic. 
• Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national 
(or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing joint annual calls for 
proposals resulting in grants to third parties with EU co-funding in this area. Financial 
support provided by the participants to third parties is one of the primary activities of 
this action in order to be able to achieve its objectives. 
• As specified in the eligibility conditions, the Partnership is open to all EU Member 
States, associated countries to Horizon Europe, OECD countries, African Union Member 
States80, MERCOSUR, CARIFORUM, Andean Community and countries with which 
the EU has concluded strategic partnerships on raw materials81 as well as trade (or 
association/economic partnership or equivalent) agreements containing raw materials 
cooperation provisions (i.e. Energy and Raw materials chapters)82. Participation remains 
open to those wanting to join during the Partnership’s lifetime. 
• Beneficiaries should preferably be national, regional or local institutions responsible for 
programming research and innovation activities in raw materials. To ensure alignment of 
R&I activities and raw materials policy participation is also additionally open to relevant 
Ministries and public institutions responsible for raw materials and R&I policy. 
• This Partnership should be implemented through a joint programme of activities ranging 
from research to coordination and networking activities, including training, 
demonstration, piloting and dissemination activities, to be structured along the following 
main building blocks:

• Actions should also provide measures contributing to the objectives of the Critical Raw 
Materials Act83 and of EU raw materials policy. 
• Partners are expected to provide financial and/or in-kind contribution, in line with the 
level of ambition of the proposed measures. The partnership should be open to including 
new partners over the lifetime of the partnership. Its governance should create a clear 
and transparent process for engaging with a broad range of stakeholders, together with 
the full members of the partnership, to ensure that the work strategically covers a wide 
range of views in the field of biodiversity, nature-based solutions and ecosystem services 
throughout the lifetime of the partnership. To ensure that all work streams are coherent 
and complementary, and to leverage knowledge investment potential, the partnership is 
expected to foster close cooperation and synergies with the projects funded under Cluster 
4 Digital, Industry and Space. It should also develop synergies with other relevant 
European initiatives, funding programmes and platforms such as EIT Raw Materials. 
• Financial support provided by the participants to third parties is one of the primary 
channels under this action to enable the partnership to achieve its objectives. The 
maximum amount to be granted to each third party is EUR 2 million. It is expected that 
the partnership organises joint calls on an annual base from 2026 to 2032 and therefore it 
should factor ample time to run the co-funded projects. 
• The total indicative budget for the partnership is EUR 300 million. The EU contribution 
will be limited to 30% of the total eligible costs of the action with a maximum of EUR 
90 million.  
The starting date of grants awarded under this topic may be as of the submission date of the 
application. Applicants should justify the need for a retroactive starting date in their 
application. Costs incurred from the starting date of the action may be considered eligible.

Expected Outcome: Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes: 
• Support the implementation of the Commission Communication on Advanced Materials 
for Industrial Leadership85. 
• Break frontiers between functional and structural materials by applying monitoring 
applications enabling infrastructure management such as tracking, self-powering and 
self-sensing to reduce maintenance costs by at least 30% compared to the state-of-the-
art. 
• Reduce the resources (materials and energy) needed for constructions and lower 
environmental impacts by applying innovative advanced materials (IAMs) with 
improved performance of structural or functional components, combining longevity and 
efficiency, repairability and circularity (improving overall materials circularity by at 
least 30%); 
• Proof of concept of the ‘safe and sustainable by design’ (SSbD) framework during the 
development phase of the new IAMs to avoid use of hazardous substances and lower 
environmental impact; 
• Promote industrial uptake of IAMs by facilitating scalability and/or integration into 
leaner industrial production processes; 
• Support acceptance of innovative construction materials for housing to achieve 
maximized user experience and comfort.   
Scope: Extend the lifetime of materials used in the construction sector (e.g. cement, concrete, 
composites, technical textiles, plaster board, pipes) for which durability is often limited by 
poor stability and low flexibility and/or by increasingly aggressive and changing 
environments. Extending a products’ life (use phase) is an important pillar of a solid 
sustainable and circular strategy because it reduces materials demands. In addition, new 
materials fit for the circular economy should be easily dismantlable into reusable or recyclable 
components. The actual condition and functional performance of products, components and 
materials should be monitored and assessed and smart maintenance and repair functions 
implemented, ideally at the level of individual products or components. Autonomous repair

systems often use sensors to detect changes in the material's condition through physical 
principles or mechanical deformation. The smart (AI) exploitation of collected data enables 
real-time monitoring of the material's condition. The surfaces created in the building process 
are ideal for smart solutions incorporating ubiquitous electronic systems. 
Proposals should develop new and/or improved IAMs that increase recyclability, circularity 
and safety of construction materials reducing (raw) materials consumption by: 
• Increased durability and reliability and reduced maintenance requirements (e.g. self-
cleaning and/or self-healing properties, self-protection, increased stress resistance and 
innovative protection treatments such as corrosion and/or erosion resistance, increased 
fatigue resistance); 
• Support smart material functionalities for continuous monitoring and in-service 
inspections, e.g. through integrated sensors, with multifunctional features (such as asset 
management tracking, self-powering and/or self-sensing for several parameters).  
Multidisciplinary research activities should address at least two of the following: 
• Develop strategies to accelerate the time-consuming performance evaluation step to 
greatly reduce the times to prototyping and then to market. 
• Enhance sensor capabilities for tailored solutions through IAMs with extended physical 
sensor functionalities for mechanical-technological traits; 
• Develop self-repairing and -healing materials for complex and resource-intensive 
structures, receptive to digital stimuli to retroactively influence material properties and 
integrating autonomous repair mechanisms to enhance their reliability (such as in 
composites, ceramics, coatings, technical textiles etc), extend their lifespan and enabling 
easy recycling; 
• Develop (AI based) models like digital twins to utilize high-dimensional new sensor data 
and generate multimodal stimuli and functionalities for customised maintenance and 
repair plans, extending product lifetime economically and environmentally; 
• Produce and share new knowledge on underlying multi-scale and multi-physics 
phenomena to better understand materials behaviour during their lifetime, develop and 
validate methodologies and suitable models to predict materials degradation (mechanical 
and/or environmental) and to assess the longevity of materials, components and products 
through accelerated testing and functional performance verification; 
• Develop IAMs fit for modular off-site processing or 3D printing onsite;  
In addition, all proposals should 
• Use new digital technologies including data driven approaches to push the frontiers of 
designing and producing IAMs with new functionalities/performance, improve materials

scalability and related processes and use analytical technologies and infrastructures to 
characterise the efficiency, quality and effectiveness of developed IAMs; 
• Contribute to the availability of FAIR86 data and methods for safety and sustainability 
assessment of IAMs and for decision-making processes (at the design, engineering and 
end-of-life stage of IAMs and products); 
• Explore possibilities to transfer and use developed IAMs or technologies in other 
sectors; 
• Assess safety, sustainability and circularity of all components during the entire 
innovation cycle as well as how to decompose and sort for enhanced recyclability of all 
components at the end of life, in line with the safe and sustainable by design (SSbD) 
framework.  
Proposals need to address both the IAM development and all the supporting technologies 
(digital and physical) needed (not existing yet) to cover the entire value chain (material 
development, validation, production, processing, use and end of life). Any existing 
technologies that do not require development or adaptation should be mentioned in the 
proposal. 
Proposals should involve appropriate expertise in Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH), 
particularly regarding the acceptance of innovative construction materials for housing for 
maximized user experience and comfort. This may involve a perception analysis of these 
materials, resulting functionalities and the development of optimization strategies. 
Proposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy, 
as outlined in the introduction to this Destination. 
Research should build on existing standards or contribute to standardisation of technologies 
encompassing sensing, self-repairing or self-healing materials. Interoperability for data 
sharing should be addressed, in accordance with the FAIR data principles. Projects should 
build on, or seek collaboration with, existing projects in EU Member States and Associated 
Countries and develop synergies with other relevant European, national or regional initiatives, 
funding programmes and platforms. Where relevant, projects are encouraged to take 
advantage of and connecting to European analytical research infrastructures and services. 
Proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research 
Centre (JRC), whose contribution could consist of providing added value on new solutions for 
advanced materials in construction, including the ability to dismount and reuse, 
multifunctionality, smart maintenance and enhanced circularity and safety. 
International cooperation is encouraged, especially with Japan.

Expected Outcome: Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes: 
• Support the implementation of the Commission Communication on Advanced Materials 
for Industrial Leadership88. 
• Prolong lifespan and performance of components and products across sectors using 
IAMs-based coatings, functionalised surfaces and/or sealings to withstand specific or 
challenging requirements and/or harsh environments; 
• Lower maintenance needs and overall reduced Cost of Ownership for essential, 
structural or functional components and products; 
• Lower environmental impact through improved resource efficiency, reduced energy 
consumption, increased recyclability at end of life and/or substitution of hazardous 
substances. 
• Proof of concept of the ‘safe and sustainable by design’ (SSbD) framework during the 
development phase of the new IAMs; 
• Promote industrial uptake of IAMs by facilitating scalability and/or integration into 
leaner industrial production processes;  
Scope: One of the main factors limiting the lifespan of products (and their components) is 
their prolonged exposure to environmental elements. The combination of different stressors 
and changing conditions (operational, daily, seasonal) results in accelerated aging and 
premature or unanticipated failures. To prevent the resulting adverse effects, protective 
coatings and sealings are key to provide additional protection without requiring the 
reassessment of the physical design of the product/component, nor the inherent properties of 
the parts to be coated/sealed. 
Moreover, performance evaluation of coated samples to select coating solutions which meet 
the demands of industrial end users constitute another bottleneck in the fast development of 
IAM-based coatings. In addition, recyclability is often hampered by the sealants and coatings

greatly reduce the times to prototyping and then to market. 
• Develop functionalised surfaces (directly functionalised or via coatings), which can 
substantially improve the integrity, efficiency and overall performance of products and 
can cope with sometimes extreme surface areas (small/large) and complex and/or high 
aspect ratio geometries requiring advanced processing and tooling; 
• Design and develop new sealants and coatings that can be applied by automated 
processes (higher speed and precision by digitalization), cured at room temperature (no 
extra heating or air conditioning of large paint shops or hangars required) and with 
curing times reduced by at least 90% compared to the state-of-the-art (in terms of 
increased productivity and/or decreased energy consumption);

Scope: The use of advanced materials93 has the potential to reinforce the Union’s resilience 
and competitiveness as well as achieving circularity, materials efficiency and overall 
sustainability targets. Public procurers can play a leading role in driving innovation and 
fostering the uptake of advanced materials, thereby speeding up the market introduction of 
technologies that enable the twin transition and EU’s resilience and economic security. 
Advanced materials drive innovations in new clean energy technologies provided for in the 
Net-Zero Industry Act and have the potential to substitute certain Critical Raw Materials 
(CRMs), thus contributing to the objectives of the CRM Act. Advanced materials can also 
replace hazardous substances, improve the environmental performance of products and 
processes, and facilitate circularity. 
Public Procurements that make better use of advanced materials can potentially achieve a 
substantial impact towards these policy objectives in all areas where the public sector is an 
important customer such as construction, mobility, electronics and energy. Examples of 
functionalities that could potentially be realised through advanced materials include thermal 
isolation and protective coatings in construction, superior reliability and durability of energy 
and mobility infrastructures, improved performance of electronic devices, increased 
circularity and cost-efficient maintenance of products. 
Mandatory requirements in public procurement procedures, relating to for example energy 
efficiency performance or environmental sustainability, are foreseen in the Energy Efficiency 
Directive 94 , the Net Zero Industry Act 95  and the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products 
Regulation96. More generally, the EU Public Procurement Directives allow contracts to be 
awarded not only based on lowest price, but also on other criteria linked to the subject matter 
of the contract, such as improved performance/functionalities provided by advanced 
materials. Furthermore, the Competitiveness Compass for the EU97 foresees the introduction 
of a European preference in public procurement for strategic sectors and technologies, 
reinforcing technological security and domestic supply chains, as well as simplifying and 
modernising rules, in particular for start-ups and innovative companies. 
The objective of this coordination and support action (CSA) is to create a Europe-wide 
consortium of public procurers that define together unmet procurement needs for innovative 
solutions based on advanced materials. 
The consortium should prepare future procurement topics to conduct Pre-Commercial 
Procurements (PCP)/Public Procurements of Innovative Solutions (PPI) that make use of 
advanced materials with novel functionalities for sectors where public procurers and key 
customers, in particular aligned with objectives pertinent to advanced materials. 
Proposal objectives should reflect making best use in public procurements of innovative 
material properties that contribute to superior product performance (including the impact on

those formulated in the Green Deal, the Net-Zero Industry Act, the Critical Raw Materials Act 
and the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation while having the potential to be 
exploited as widely as possible. 
Activities supported by this CSA should include the following aspects: 
• open market consultation with the industry; 
• market analysis and analysis of potential barriers (status of market developments 
regarding advanced materials versus the procurement needs, standardisation, 
certification, regulatory requirements, intellectual property rights, contracting models, 
payment schemes, etc.); 
• consultations with other public buyers and relevant stakeholders such as end-users to 
prepare for a future market uptake of the solutions and effective use of innovation 
procurement (PCP/PPI).

1. Create a pioneer federated digital infrastructure for advanced materials research and 
development, demonstrating use cases facilitating industrial uptake and offering a 
feedback loop to academic research;  

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025

Part 7 - Page 93 of 339 
2. Give researchers from industry and academia access to interoperable, heterogeneous and 
FAIR98 data sources and computational tools that support the workflows for the design 
and development of advanced materials;  
3. Address the requirements of experimental workflows for high-quality, well-structured 
and documented primary data by providing tailored solutions to experimentalists;  
4. Provide a framework to support self-driving labs using the digital infrastructure, 
enabling to use of state-of-the-art AI technologies and predictive modelling techniques 
in industry and academia;  
5. Devise mechanisms for long term sustainability and expansion to future use cases.   
Scope: This action will accelerate R&I in the area of advanced materials by bringing together 
at EU level experience, knowledge and resources, from existing and new national digital 
infrastructures for advanced materials design and development. 
It will set the ground for the implementation of a long term sustainable European digital 
infrastructure for advanced materials R&I as announced in the Communication on Advanced 
Materials for Industrial Leadership99, supporting academic and industrial collaborations. 
Such a digital infrastructure should: 
• Interconnect existing and new infrastructures devoted to advanced materials design and 
development across the EU supported by AI tool and facilitate access to High-
Performance Computing facilities. 
• Help researchers and innovators from across Europe to significantly accelerate the 
design, development, characterisation and testing of new or improved advanced 
materials in a controlled environment. 
• Foster trust in data sharing among stakeholders (including researchers, research 
organisations, industry and SMEs) based on FAIR data principles, while also fostering 
common materials taxonomies, ontologies and data interoperability. 
• Be based on an inclusive approach that fosters contributions from academia and 
industry, across different sectors, using a user-centric view that takes into account 
intellectual property rights and ownership. 
• Support virtual design of advanced materials and related processing. Foster the progress 
towards self-driving labs which are widely accessible to European researchers.  
To achieve these goals, beneficiaries are in principle expected to be publicly funded 
organisations with the necessary expertise, which are mandated by their competent ministry. 
They must be able to function as major (e.g., national or regional) hubs and contact points for 
stakeholders in national ecosystems, exploring models for participation and contribution,

while also working closely with pan-European organisations working on the digitalisation of 
R&I on advanced materials. 
The inclusive nature of the Materials Commons for Europe shall be facilitated through the 
creation of an advisory board as part of the project composed of relevant ministries or national 
funding bodies supporting short- and long-term solutions. The applicants are encouraged to 
consider a project duration of around four years. 
The envisioned project should follow the following phases:       
1. Phase 1: Planning and Framework Establishment  
• Developing functional and non-functional requirements and identifying existing 
solutions (e.g., cloud solutions, middleware, data spaces) that can be used to accelerate, 
or be integrated into, the infrastructure. Identification of possible use of existing 
infrastructures and resources, including support for and integration of self-driving labs. 
• Planning a governance framework, able to implement the infrastructure meeting the 
functional and non-functional requirements, including a strategy for adhesion of new 
entities in the long term. 
• Agreeing on long-term sustainability plan, taking into account academic, industry needs 
and aspects going beyond R&I. 
• Determining compatibility issues and standardisation needs, also in relation to semantic 
interoperability. 
• Setting out key stakeholders, including from academia and industry and related projects 
and initiatives which will be the users of the infrastructure.  
1. Phase 2: Initial build-up  
• Building up trust infrastructure and enabling remote access. 
• Governance framework for data, computational tools and workflows at operational level. 
• Standards and machine readable, domain-specific data schemas and Advanced 
Programming Interfaces, enabling semantic interoperability and interconnections 
between different datasets and tools. 
• Support for European self-driving labs and their interconnection to the infrastructure, 
enabling them to reach higher levels of data-driven decision making and automated 
workflows.  
1. Phase 3: Demonstration  
• Integration of workflows and tools, including those aimed at creation of primary data.

• 5 use cases across different sectors and related demonstrators, facilitating industrial 
uptake and offering a feedback loop to academic research. 
• concrete steps towards sustainability.  
Complementarity and synergies should be sought with existing national initiatives such as 
Material Digital100, DIADEM101 and CaPeX102, as well as with innovation-related strategies, 
policies, programmes and plans at national and/or regional level. This also extends to EU 
initiatives such as the proposed “Innovative Materials for EU” partnership, Data Spaces 
including in particular the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)103, EuroHPC104 and Open

The action should also envisage the coordination with a possible mutual learning exercise 
(MLE) on this topic, targeted to countries leading on this area and those who still need to 
improve national digital infrastructure, enabling an exchange of experience with digital 
infrastructures, and creating synergies with ongoing related initiatives. 
Proposals should involve appropriate expertise in Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH), in 
particular to achieve a user-centred design that facilitates access across different sectors, and 
by different communities with different characteristics.

Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Demonstrated added value of Innovative Advanced materials (IAMs) such as Two-
dimensional materials and EO polymers for integrated photonic devices and systems, 
with focus on low power consumption, enabling future telecommunication networks in 
which Europe can build competitive value chains. 
• IAMs for miniaturized and outperforming photonic integrated technologies e.g. in terms 
of performance, power, cost, novel functionality enabling the development of future-
proof, scalable, low-power and high-bandwidth devices.  
Scope: IAMs can be the ideal candidate for several applications in photonics and 
optoelectronics. These include ultrafast integrated photonic circuits, with modulators, 
waveguides, detectors, emitters and switches, which play a crucial role in the ongoing quest to 
increase the speed of data transmission in telecommunications networks. In addition, they find 
utility in high-frequency transmitter modulators and receiver demodulators, which are 
essential for advancing wireless telecommunications technologies. They can also serve as 
integral components in optical interconnects for data centers, high-performance computing 
(HPCs), and artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) computing systems. 
The main objective of this topic is to explore innovative solutions based on IAMs, including 
2DMs, that offer state-of-the-art performance and low power consumption, while 
demonstrating scalability for volume production, thus exploiting the semiconductor 
manufacturing infrastructure. The envisioned compact devices are expected to be designed to 
be compatible with low-power driving electronics and thus reduce energy consumption. 
Solutions should be compatible with existing photonic integrated platforms and low-voltage 
electronics. 
Proposals are expected to integrate the value chain and include relevant manufacturing 
technologies required to bring the developed devices to market. Prototypes are expected to be 
developed using packaged devices, including electronics, to enable testing in relevant 
environments. 
Efforts should be focused on envisioning optimized routes for electronic and photonic design, 
fabricating photonic circuits, producing IAMs, conducting testing, executing wafer-scale 
fabrication, and performing co-integration and co-packaging, ultimately leading to 
demonstrations of the developed technologies and their added values.

Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Conformable, flexible or stretchable electronic devices and circuits, enabling improved 
user experience and adoption; 
• Sustainable electronics based on low environmental impact materials, promoting 
reparability and/or recyclability and compatible with energy and resource efficient 
manufacturing processes; 
• Materials tailored for solution-processed electronics such as semiconductor, conductive, 
dielectric, electroactive polymers, low environmental impact and/or functional 
substrates, etc. enabling high performance and reliable flexible electronics devices.  
Scope: The concept of "ubiquitous electronics" can be a unique opportunity for the EU, 
opening up new avenues for e.g., wearable electronics, e-textile, e-skin, wellbeing solutions 
and Internet of wearable things (IoWT), which represent strategic markets for the EU. 
Innovative and advanced materials (IAMs) can enable new technologies and the much-needed 
paradigm of an electronic device that can adapt to any substrate. Despite the progress made in 
this field, current devices are made up of a limited proportion of flexible, conformable, and 
stretchable components, mainly sensors, while the rest of the circuit remains rigid, limiting 
this technology shift. 
The overall objective is to discover Innovative Advanced Materials (IAMs), including 2DMs, 
with improved properties in terms of flexibility, conformability and stretchability that can 
enable novel flexible electronic applications, with a focus on environmentally friendly 
technologies with reduced carbon footprint processing. Proposals should address most of the 
following challenges: 
• Discomfort of existing wearables leading to non-adoption 
• Environmental impact of current electronics due to the use of hazardous and/or critical 
raw materials, energy-hungry and resources intensive processes 
• Low or limited performance and durability of existing materials for high performance 
and reliable flexible electronic devices and circuits 
• Limited integrability of current electronics: size and/or weight, complex cabling, 
interface between flexible and rigid components, design limitations (i.e., pattern 
geometry, thickness, dimensions).  
Proposals should address reparability and/or recyclability of devices and circuits e.g. 
reversible adhesives and interconnects, low temperature soldering, bio-based or recycled 
substrates such as low thermal budget paper and inks, bio-resorbable conductive materials for 
the next generation of transient implanted medical devices, etc., compatibility with energy and 
resource efficient manufacturing processes e.g., printing, thermoforming, high pressure 
forming, lamination, injection moulding, etc.

• Demonstrate the applicability of the ‘Safe and Sustainable by Design’ (SSbD) 
framework 115  to avoid regrettable substitution when developing innovative safe 
alternatives to PFAS.   
Scope: PFAS are a large class of substances used in a wide range of applications (for instance, 
as adhesives, coatings, lubricants, sealants, surfactants), for their technical and/or safety 
functions (e.g., water and oil repellence, antiadhesion, thermal & chemical stability) 116. 
Nevertheless, PFAS have been detected in groundwater, surface water and soil, the 
remediation of which is extremely problematic117,118. Their accumulation in the environment 
has been linked to negative effects for the wildlife and the human health, including 
carcinogenic, mutagenic, reprotoxic and toxic effects for the endocrine system119. In January 
2023, five national authorities submitted to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) a PFAS 
restriction dossier to ban the manufacture, placing on the market and use of PFAS as a 
chemical class in all uses, with few exemptions120. 
The Commission initiative for SSbD sets a framework which should be a reference in the 
proposal. The new alternatives to be developed should meet the technical functions required 
in the specific applications and align with such framework. 
Proposals should address at least one industrial application and should develop one or more 
new chemical substances or technologies to replace existing PFAS used, according to 
abovementioned applications and functions, in one of the following areas: 
• Electronics, electrical appliances and grids (e.g., wires, cables, heat transfer fluids, 
transformers, switchgears), where PFAS are currently used to provide a combination of 
technical and/or safety functions to withstand impact of high temperature, pressure and 
chemicals, ensure corrosion inhibition and non-flammability. 
• Construction technologies (e.g., carpeting, drywall, paintings, foams) where PFAS are 
currently used to provide a combination of technical functions such as resistance in harsh 
environments and for wetting agents. 
• Technical textiles (e.g., personal protective equipment, construction textiles, filtration 
and separation media, technical textiles for transport applications) where PFAS are 
currently used for their repellence but also heat stability and corrosion inhibition.

• Automotive parts (e.g. electrical parts including batteries, membranes, hoses and pipes, 
brakes, rubber processing) where PFAS are also currently used121.  
All actors along the value chain should be involved to ensure the new substance has a clear 
use case, market and potential to grow. 
Multidisciplinary research activities should address all of the following: 
• The ‘Safe and Sustainable by Design’ framework should be applied when developing the 
alternative(s) and the assessment results be published and underlying methods and data 
made FAIR across the whole value chain; 
• The selection of the PFAS alternatives to be developed should be justified with a 
technological and socio-economic analysis, also considering potential impacts on health 
and reproductive health; 
• Novel PFAS-free materials or structures should undergo testing under relevant 
conditions to ensure their properties meet or exceed the properties of PFAS-based 
solutions across various applications; 
• The substitution barriers for the selected applications should be identified and a driving 
mechanism for a maximal substitution in the targeted value chains proposed; 
• Challenges for the adaption of existing production lines should be identified and 
solutions proposed; 
• Communication and other outreach actions to all stakeholders and specifically citizens 
about the benefits of the developed ‘Safe and Sustainable by Design’ alternatives to 
PFAS substances. 
• Proposals should involve appropriate expertise in Social Sciences and Humanities 
(SSH), e.g. with communities of citizens to engage in product reliability and consumer 
rights. At least, an analysis of how the introduction of such alternatives is positively or 
negatively considered by users and the general population, disruptive (or not) for the 
established social norms or behavioural patterns, should be conducted; 
• Policy briefs will be reported to the European Commission on a yearly basis to 
communicate on the key results and achievements.  
Proposals should indicate to which chapters of the Strategic Research and Innovation Plan for 
chemicals and materials122 they will contribute. 
Proposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy.

planetary boundaries. The tools should be in compliance with the Safe and Sustainable by 
Design136 framework, hence to be considered as a reference in the proposal. 
Multidisciplinary research activities should address all the following: 
• Develop advanced, user-friendly LCA tools and methodologies that allow for a 
comprehensive assessment of the environmental sustainability of the entire lifecycle of 
chemicals, materials and resulting products whilst considering planetary boundaries; 
• Develop LCA datasets, in particular building on the EC PEF methods, from design to 
end-of-life of at least three relevant chemicals or materials and a selection of their 
resulting products. The selected substances should be emerging alternatives to 
substances of concern (as defined in the ESPR proposal) and should have a high socio-
economic value; 
• Develop solutions to fill in the identified data and assessment gaps and to estimate LCA 
uncertainty, using advanced digital technologies, modelling, machine learning and 
artificial intelligence; 
• Feed relevant sustainability databases managed by the European Institutions and 
Agencies, such as the European Platform on LCA137 (EPLCA), with FAIR138 data and 
ensure new tools developed are findable by stakeholders. 
• Provide guidance for LCA modelling of circularity scenarios for chemicals, materials 
and resulting products, in alignment with EC PEF methods and the SSbD framework; 
• Ensure that the developed tools, methods and datasets are cost-effective and user-
friendly in order to increase uptake and use in industry; 
• Develop guidelines and user-friendly solutions to enable a seamless integration of the 
new LCA approaches with existing safety assessment tools and methods (notably the EC 
PEF method) to ensure a holistic SSbD assessment from the early innovation phases; 
• Engage with the wider stakeholder community, especially with SMEs, to promote a 
harmonised use of the proposed tools and methodologies; 
• Perform training and knowledge transfer activities to promote LCA and SSbD 
knowledge as well as life cycle thinking within the R&I ecosystem; 
• Projects should contribute to yearly policy briefs and technical discussions, for example 
under the Eco-design for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR)139 or with the EF

Part 7 - Page 108 of 339 
Scope: Up to 80% of textile and apparel products consumed in Europe are partially or fully 
made outside Europe, exploiting lower labour cost as well as laxer local standards and 
regulations with regards to environmental, human health and labour rights protection. This 
offshoring of production has slowed textile manufacturing technology innovation in Europe 
and led to a complex long-lead time supply chain, generating unnecessary production and pre-
consumer waste from unused mass-produced materials and unsold products not meeting 
actual demand. 
Digitalisation in product development, production and on-demand supply chains has the 
potential to significantly reduce such overproduction, and enable business models that can 
competitively offer rapid short run or single piece production as well as related repair or end-
of-life dismantling services for effective local recycling. 
These aspects are particularly important in view of the new requirements to be set under the 
Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation under which textiles are flagged as one of the 
priority product groups for the elaboration of a sustainable policy framework that could 
consider durability, recyclability, repairability and recycled content the most important 
product aspects 
Proposals should address at least one of the two following activities: 
1. Small scale demonstration, experimentation or piloting of approaches, processes or 
technologies for: 
• Complex manufacturing operations including yarn or fabric production and final product 
assembly that go beyond state-of-the-art processes such as digital garment printing; 
• Seamless interoperable data flows and transparency towards the end user that pursue and 
harness waste minimisation, short time to market and trust-building between supply 
chain partners and end users; 
• Valorisation of locally available renewable raw materials (biobased or recycled) and 
regional production capacities that allow for shortest time to market and lowest 
environmental footprint; 
• Micro-factories that can flexibly combine small-scale local production, repair, and re- 
and de-manufacturing operations.  
2. Uptake of innovative service-driven business models that maximise consumer value 
creation and lowers total cost of ownership from high-quality long-lasting products. 
Proposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy, 
as outlined in the introduction to this Destination. 
Proposals should include financial support to third party (FSTP) to maximise the number of 
SMEs involved in small-scale innovation projects. All such innovation projects should 
include at least one advanced technology provider; one manufacturing SME; and one end-
market facing company, such as a retailer or a professional or consumer service provider. The 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 109 of 339 
partners should be from at least two different countries. FSTP funding can be provided only to 
SME participants, while the active participation of larger companies in such innovation 
projects is encouraged. The involvement of start-ups is also specifically encouraged. To 
ensure a focused effort, each third-party beneficiary should receive funding up to EUR 60 
000, in projects with an indicative duration of 18 months. 
International cooperation may be considered, in particular with countries that are advanced in 
the field. 
Where relevant, projects should build on or seek collaboration with existing projects and 
develop synergies with other relevant European, national or regional initiatives and funding 
programmes. 
This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership ‘Textiles for the Future’.

Destination 3: Developing an agile and secure single market and infrastructure for data-
services and trustworthy artificial intelligence services  
The next stage of the data economy will shift data flows from the consumer-to-business 
model to business-to-business, business-to-consumer, consumer-to-consumer, business-to-
government and government-to-business models. 
Destination 3 will continue to support technologies that are crucial for the next stages of the 
data economy, such as privacy preserving technologies and compliance technologies, source 
and transaction integrity (such as blockchain), and technologies underpinning interoperable 
and compliant industrial, public and personal data spaces and secure data exchanges. 
Rebalancing the data, computing, and learning capacity across the cloud-to-edge/internet of 
things continuum will let businesses, public organisations and individuals exploit data for 
trustworthy and bias-free decision making. 
Wide availability of reliable data, like from the European data spaces in the Digital Europe 
Programme, together with new interactive, immersive and context-aware technologies – 
digital twins, cyber-physical systems, internet of things and virtual worlds – will make this 
easier than ever before. This will help all people groups benefit from the power of data and AI 
in a fair, unbiased and compliant way. 
Industrial virtual worlds that are open and interconnected bring alternative but realistic and 
coherent views on what are widely distributed, diverse and complex devices, processes and 
value chains. Beyond visualisation and simulation, and thanks to new types of interfaces (like 
XR/VR), secure data sharing and distributed computing technologies, they allow for safe and 
natural ways of interaction and control, high level of response to local events, real-time 
optimisation and dynamic re-configuration in key application areas like for: i) the integration 
of renewable energy sources, ii) smart farming, iii) agile supply chains and logistics, and iv) 
hyperflexible manufacturing and manufacturing-as-a-service. Similarly, data-driven tools, AI, 
language technology, adaptive and self-programmed robotics, and new energy-aware 
programming solutions will improve operational and energy efficiency in lead sectors like 
healthcare, manufacturing, mobility, and the energy sector itself. 
Quantum technologies will further expand the data economy in high value-added areas where 
traditional approaches struggle to deliver, for instance, highly secure communication of 
critical data, or on exponentially complex simulations, machine learning and optimisation. 
Quantum networks will provide highly secure, tamper-free data storage and transmission, 
which can be critical in situations where the integrity and confidentiality of the data are 
paramount, like in the health sector, smart cities, energy systems or other critical 
infrastructure. 
The strategic development of communication networks (5G, 6G) as well as the future 
structures of data intermediation and governance, high-capacity computing and artificial 
intelligence through the cloud and the edge are very important to the single market, Europe´s 
economic security and sustainable competitiveness. They are also vital for trustworthy data- 
and AI-based services.

Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Strengthen European industrial ecosystems for the 3C Network, while enabling the path 
towards sustainability and competitiveness of key vertical sectors in the EU, to be 
supported in the work programme 2026-2027 of Horizon Europe by future large-scale 
pilot focusing on 3Cs demand in vertical industrial sectors such as “industrial virtual 
worlds” (automotive, aerospace, processing, manufacturing, agriculture, electronics), 
services (mobility, energy, smart communities, health) or others. 
• Strategic industrial cooperation among network and data processing stakeholders which 
enable new revenue streams in support of viable communication infrastructures by 
building open platforms, underpinning an emerging industrial open telco edge cloud 
ecosystem to be established in Europe. 
• The pilot should devise appropriate cooperation mechanisms with the Open Internet 
Stack actions, to help defining the requirements for the development of the building 
blocks and ensure their integration in the pilot, including envisaging mechanisms for 
testing and integration of the solutions developed by the Open Internet Stack. 
• A European vision of advanced digital infrastructures through the convergence of 
connectivity with interoperable edge and cloud computing services. Moreover, the large-
scale pilot should seek and include sufficient evidence of a clear commitment from the 
major European telecom, cloud and edge providers to industrialise further the results of 
the pilot among the major stakeholders, in particular by considering the necessary 
business adaptations and future perspectives, etc. In this context, an advisory group of 
end users should be set up to discuss and advise about user requirements to be 
considered in relation to the pilots. This group will collect requirements from a large 
range of users and test them through small demonstrations.

Scope: The recent Commission White Paper “How to master Europe’s digital infrastructure 
needs?” highlights the convergence of electronic communications networks and cloud 
services, and call for the strengthening of the EU “Telco Edge Cloud” infrastructure, by 
creating the 3C Network (Connected Collaborative Computing). 
The convergence of connectivity, including mobile networks (5G and 5G advanced), 
combined with computing environments at the edge and cloud is a unique opportunity for the 
European telecom industry to drive a European vision of next generation digital 
infrastructures and meet future processing demands of IoT and AI. Investing into future 
computing and connectivity paradigms will strengthen the industrial European supply side 
and deliver an enablement for the path towards sustainability of key sectors in the demand 
side. 
Increased density of edge and cloud facilities is needed to sustain adoption of innovative and 
sovereign telco edge cloud technologies across Europe. Backed by ubiquitous connectivity to 
deliver the right performance in terms of bandwidth and latency, Europe’s infrastructure will 
require advanced network management and orchestration technology as well as neutral 
interconnection services to guarantee efficient infrastructure utilisation and enable innovative 
use cases at scale. 
The 3C Network large-scale pilot (focusing on the supply side) aims at setting up end-to-end 
integrated infrastructures and platforms, bringing together players from different segments of 
the connectivity and compute value chain and beyond. The main target is to research and 
validate the integration of device, network, cloud and edge computing, and communication 
capabilities for telco edge cloud deployments to realize a ubiquitous mesh of computing and 
communication resources. This will complement the Telco Edge Cloud reference 
deployments of Digital Europe and IPCEI-CIS and will feed into future deployment 
initiatives. 
Therefore, the scope for the action would be the following: 
• Researching and prototyping at scale end-to-end telco edge cloud integrated 
infrastructures and platforms, bringing together players from different segments of the 
connectivity value chain and beyond, such as operators, system integrators, 
network/cloud/edge suppliers, experts on AI and (wireless) communication, experts on 
testing and validation of network technologies and services, IoT platform providers et al. 
• Developing open orchestration platforms across the telco edge cloud continuum, to 
support unlocking the transformative value of AI for European businesses and driving 
business growth in multiple industries strategic for Europe and associated countries. 
• Integrating AI solutions for optimising the orchestration of the different resources to be 
managed by the pilot actions, such as bandwidth, spectrum, computing, hardware, other 
user requirements. 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 114 of 339 
• Investigation, testing, validation and demonstration of solutions and prototypes of the 
simultaneous use of integrated devices, edge and cloud computing and communication 
resources in operational environments (including both public networks and large private 
networks), ensuring high level of security and privacy, energy efficiency, transparency 
and control of the ecological footprint. 
• Investigation, testing, validation and demonstration of integration of available 
infrastructures as cloud-edge continuum with distributed systems such as blockchain 
infrastructure and services, data spaces and seamless and comprehensive AI systems in 
the process of creation of decentralised digital infrastructure network, including the 
compliance with applicable EU regulations. 
• Exploration of novel approaches for cybersecurity by design and sustainability in 
advanced communication infrastructure.  
With radical changes triggered by GenAI, as well as AI applications penetrating more and 
more industrial domains, demands for low latency are looming. The pilot should have to 
tackle the network evolution complementing the cloud with progress towards the edge, as 
well as needing reliability from the mobile networks. 
Key aspects to be researched, validated and demonstrated by the 3C Network end-to-end 
infrastructures include: 
• AI-enabled orchestration and quality assurance tools, algorithms and techniques which 
cater for hybrid multi-cloud technologies. 
• Enablers for multi-level (networks, edge, cloud, and services) federation management 
and interoperability. 
• Tools and mechanisms that facilitate the standardised exposure of network functions. 
• Enablement of Edge-as-a-Service approaches that effectively integrate cloud 
computing's multi-tenancy and resource sharing concepts into access networks. 
• Security and Compliance mechanisms targeted for telco edge cloud. 
• Tools for guaranteed end-to-end QoS and QoE across heterogeneous network, cloud and 
edge infrastructures. 
• Mechanisms to exploit specialised hardware and accelerators to address the strict the 
requirements (e.g. latency, energy efficiency) of virtualised network functions. 
• Investigation on the trade-offs associated to Edge nodes density and placement required 
in telco edge cloud deployments to achieve the target latency rates. 
• Lightweight virtualisation and cloud-native approaches for virtualised network 
functions. 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 115 of 339 
• Novel approaches to handle user mobility to ensure edge service continuity and quality 
of service. 
• Privacy preserving record linkage on individual citizen level and device-related level to 
foster meaningful linkage of data for secondary usage.  
Thanks to these, the pilot and its associated research should support the emergence of telco 
edge cloud as-a-service approaches that successfully implement multi-tenancy and resource 
sharing notions from cloud computing into network infrastructure and resources. In addition, 
the project infrastructures should cater for the pragmatic complexities associated with the 
physical placement of the various types of telco edge cloud platforms (near, far, regional,) 
across the territory considering the necessary trade-offs between performance, capacity, and 
costs. 
Furthermore, the pilot should tackle the need for multi-cloud and edge service orchestration at 
scale, which enables workload portability across providers and technologies as well as 
effective service placement and lightweight and cloud-native forms for NFV and optimisation 
by means of acceleration, multi-cloud orchestration, multi-level federation and mobility 
management. 
Moreover, the technical solutions in the pilot should investigate the use of AI to handle the 
optimal allocation and optimisation of the operation of the digital infrastructures resultant of 
the combination of distributed compute and network resources of the edge cloud compute 
continuum in a predictive and efficient manner and at scale. These should take into 
consideration the appropriate QoS trade-offs in relation to bandwidth, spectrum, computing, 
hardware and other functional and non-functional requirements, cater for the need for AI/ML 
to improve optimisation of assets and process and closed-loop automation, and target 
development and life-cycle management of AI models and resource management tools for the 
optimal management of combined and converged network, cloud and edge infrastructures. It 
will integrate security and privacy by design into account and seek to incorporate mechanisms 
such as edge discovery and deployment as-a-service delivery, end-to-end network and 
compute performance, energy efficiency and mobility management, including the Non-
Terrestrial Network component for ubiquity. 
The pilot should provide an open, multi-supplier, multi-vendor, and interoperable Telco 
Edge Cloud reference architecture and ecosystem that encourages cooperation and 
cooperative development among all key stakeholders, with broad representation of MS/AC, 
owing to the joint research to be implemented. Furthermore, the pilot should define open 
access policies and mechanisms that aim to maximise the impact of the provided 
infrastructure which take into consideration the long-term sustainability and addressing 
different uses by industrial and research communities. When necessary, these should explore 
collaboration with complementary actions addressing the demand side. 
Project participants should analyse the existing standards landscape as a key state-of-the-art 
input when planning their project activities, and relevant open-source projects (e.g., Sylva, 
ANUJET, Nephio, CAMARA). The development paths of the critical technologies are 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 116 of 339 
expected to be merged and aligned to support the standardisation and uptake of 6G and Web 
4.0. 
The pilot should help maturing the technologies resulting from medium TRLs projects, while 
performing its own research towards enabling and prototyping of converged telco cloud edge 
platforms in operational and multi-suppliers, multi-domain and multi-tenant environments. 
The pilot should cover research on infrastructure and platforms mid-TRLs telco edge cloud 
technologies, including development of telco-cloud network resources orchestration, demos, 
proof of concepts and early deployment of technologies. 
The main achievements of the pilot should be showcased by means of small-scale 
demonstrations, that could be scaled up in future work programmes, for instance 
demonstrators on virtual worlds for industrial settings. 
The pilot should ensure a high degree of participation of stakeholders from the relevant 
technological sectors, including SMEs, scaleups and start-ups, as well as properly consider the 
demand side from vertical sectors and broad representation of MS/AC, also in view of the 
planned demand-side large-scale pilots. In this regard, proposals should clearly define the 
roles and responsibilities of the participating stakeholders in developing, testing, validating, 
updating, maintaining and/ or using the technologies and services of the 3Cs network. The 
pilot’s Consortium should also define a policy on the ownership and access of 3Cs network 
resources and facilities, during the Horizon Europe project and beyond. 
Proposals are expected to build synergies and ensure complementarities with relevant topics 
under SNS JU Work Programme 2022-2024, Digital Europe Programme WP2023-2024, 
IPCEI-CIS, Connecting Europe Facility. 
The large-scale pilot would ideally reuse and extend relevant open-source frameworks and 
capitalise on existing testing and trial platforms from European or national initiatives 148 
among which the IPCEI-CIS, SNS Stream C (dedicated to the development of EU-wide 
experimentation platforms incorporating promising 6G enablers), SNS Stream D projects 
(which focuses on implementing large-scale trials and targets specific verticals of high 
economic and societal importance), and other SNS projects, results from Open Internet Stack 
action, the Cloud-Edge-IoT HE projects, and the Digital Europe Programme’s Reference 
edge-cloud deployments, the “Empowering AI across the continuum” and the “Software 
engineering for AI” R&I areas, as well as research results on infrastructure and platforms. It 
should also establish strong relationship and collaboration with complementary EU-funded 
research activities, and also ensure close interaction with the relevant constituencies driving 
that research, including the Open Internet Stack constituencies. Relevant research from both 
the supply and the demand side of 3C networks should be considered in this regard, thus 
ensuring participation of research organisations from all across the value chain. 
Finally, digital autonomy in edge and cloud implies that computation infrastructure should be 
able to be sourced from European technology, including non-terrestrial network 
 
148 
Such as UNICO 6G in Spain, CAMPUS-OS in Germany, 6G Flagship in Finland, etc.

Part 7 - Page 117 of 339 
infrastructure. The subsequent step following the EU investments in processors for HPC 
(under the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking) is to extend its success to the rest of the computing 
continuum. Therefore, the project will also seek to coordinate with other EU (HE) research 
activities with a view to integrating new processor architectures into cloud edge 
infrastructures as they become available.

Expected Outcome: The supply-side large-scale pilot (LSP) of end-to-end infrastructures 
integrating device, network computing and communication capabilities will develop 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025

Part 7 - Page 118 of 339 
horizontal facilities for the benefit of constituencies represented in the supply LSP and also 
beyond, including those focusing on the demand side of the referred infrastructures. This CSA 
is expected to bring together all those stakeholders. In any case, the CSA action should be 
prepared, managed and coordinated by key stakeholders in the field, while it would be 
important that the coordinator adopts a neutral position. 
Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes: 
• Coordination of the different stakeholder communities in the scope of the supply LSP 
work (software, hardware, computing, telcos, AI, cloud...), bringing stakeholders 
together to work on a common plan and technology roadmap on supply and demand of 
end-to-end infrastructures integrating device, network computing and communication 
capabilities, monitoring implementation and identifying gaps. 
• Enable the supply-side LSP to consider the demand-side perspective, including 
requirements from the different applications/user communities. 
• Help stakeholders build small, and later larger-scale, demos based on the developments 
of the supply-side LSP, as well as developments from future Horizon research actions as 
possible and appropriate. 
• Assist stakeholders from the different segments of the value chain (telecoms, software 
providers, middleware stack providers, etc.) to converge towards a shared approach, 
while modular and flexible, for telco-edge-cloud infrastructure and services 
• Put in place mechanisms for exchange, collaboration and shared governance to facilitate 
smooth cooperation between supply and demand-side activities, including the Open 
Internet Stack, towards a common platform approach across industrial actors, including a 
repository with critical mass of largely open-source building blocks, as well as 
maintenance and support services.  
Scope: The expected scope of the CSA for this governance mechanism to function would be 
the following: 
• Consolidate priorities and maximise benefits across different demand perspectives and 
timelines for key infrastructure services to be implemented. 
• Ensure alignment of demand and supply side strategies and roadmaps, in line with (and 
contributing to) the White Paper on communication infrastructures and other relevant 
EU policy. 
• Ensure coordination and integration of the work of the actions on the supply side pilot 
and the Open Internet Stack. 
• Open-source delivery of Telco Edge Cloud building blocks by the supply side pilot, 
which will be the foreseen backbone to articulate the cooperation among supply- and 
demand-side LSPs. 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 119 of 339 
• These open-source modules should be aligned with industrial interests and where 
appropriate with common European building blocks including with the developments at 
IPCEI-CIS Telco Edge Cloud community initiatives (e.g. Sylva, Anuket, Nephio and 
CAMARA).149 
• The demand-side developments in the relevant verticals will offer a continuous feedback 
loop to the supply side endeavours, while they will benefit from the progressive 
developments of the supply LSP. 
• Provide a foundation for exploitation of European technology developed under the 3C 
initiative as an alternative to the platforms led by large multinationals. The project 
should provide a forum for consultation and input of the demand-side application sectors 
and verticals into the development of the supply-side architecture and building blocks. 
• Identification of paradigms shifts evolving in relevant vertical domains like virtual 
worlds as a driver for emerging network virtualisation and performance as well as 
vertical services like mobility, communities or energy. 
• Assessment of monetising edge computing, interoperability of middleware and SW 
framework through trend scouting on markets, value chains and ecosystems in the area 
of dynamic content delivery, AI adoption for telco operation and edge computing, 
convergence across the telco-cloud-edge- IoT continuum.

• A flourishing European ecosystem of contributors to digital commons– e.g., individuals, 
SMEs, academics - stimulated by critical challenges around sovereignty, trust, and user 
empowerment.  
Tools, services, and insights supporting compliance with and implementation of EU legal 
framework e.g., EUDI, CRA, DMA, DSA, GDPR, Data Act, DGA. 
Scope: This action will foster an Open-Source framework, developed through commons, i.e. 
Open Source software governed by communities of contributors, that will provide key 
technology components for the operation of the 3C large scale pilot. They will be addressing 
relevant areas, structuring them in a stack and supporting the development of 3C building 
blocks making them available through a library of digital commons supporting applications 
on top of the European providers ecosystem. 
It will mainly cover three technology areas: 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 122 of 339 
• Trust technologies such as privacy enhancing technologies, AI-based agents and trusted 
technologies for identities allowing exchanges across multiple 3C networks, providing 
the users with transparent, auditable, secure, and resilient building blocks and tools 
across the internet stack. 
• Network and connectivity technologies according to the identified needs of the 3C large 
scale pilot. 
• Decentralised technologies for an immersive world notably based on open standards 
ensuring interoperable flow of data and events across the 3C pilot networks and 
operators.  
In order to implement the European vision of next generation digital infrastructures (3Cs 
networks), applicants should devise appropriate mechanisms for cooperation with the 3C 
pilot: 
• To ensure the integration of requirements and specifications stemming from the 3C large 
scale pilots. 
• To ensure the 3C large scale pilot’s swift integration of the building blocks developed by 
the Open Internet Stack, including envisaging mechanisms for testing and integration of 
the solutions.  
Applicants should provide concrete plans on how such work should be organised in close 
cooperation with the 3C large scale pilot to decide the building blocks that will be prioritised, 
facilitate their integration in the 3C large scale pilot and avoid any duplication of the work. If 
applicants opt for financial support to third parties, the solutions selected under the Open 
Calls should form a coherent portfolio and duplications should be avoided. The 3C CSA will 
ensure co-ordination and monitoring for duplication risks across the 3C projects’ activities. 
Applicants could also decide to select and fund third party projects, wherever required, 
through up to 70% of their project’s budget for financial support to third parties. 
If applicants opt for financial support to third parties, they should target calls towards the 
Open-Source communities actively influencing the course of the Internet. This action is aimed 
in particular at leveraging the European Open Source community – SMEs, research institutes 
and individual researchers and developers – with solid experience with development of 
solutions in line with EU rules and values. The calls should aim at improving trust, 
transactions, decentralisation implementing optimal balance between distribution, security 
(including AI for security), AI usage and energy efficiency targeting climate neutrality 
objectives. Applicants should then also define the mechanisms for maturing third parties’ 
projects e.g., security and accessibility audits, packaging of the stack for easy deployment, 
localisation of the software in EU languages, documentation best practices, performance 
optimisation and advising on licensing. 
Applicants should detail the path to growth for third parties’ projects e.g., by actively 
animating communities, creating momentum among like-minded efforts, defining how 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 123 of 339 
projects will gain critical mass and what services will be provided for reaching such stage. 
Proposals should also detail the strategy for standardisation. 
In addition to contributing to the 3C large scale pilot, applicants should demonstrate how the 
software produced will be operationalised as a stack of open libraries accessible through a 
common European repository and maximising re-use, reproducibility, and resilience for 
adopters. 
Applicants should actively manage the portfolio of funded projects and provide a coherent 
overall picture in relation to the 3Cs objectives, describing how mature solutions are and 
ensuring trusted and easy deployment capabilities for each building block through packaged 
stack. 
Applicants should strive for identification of common tools and stimulate maximum re-use of 
components coming from other funded projects e.g., interoperable identity and credential 
management tools, common packaging solutions, tools for decentralised social media. 
Applicants should seek active collaboration with other initiatives addressing internet 
commons of relevance to 3Cs at national, European levels and beyond Europe including with 
European technology industries. 
Applicants should demonstrate their experience and understanding of Open-Source 
communities and their expertise covering the full Open-Source life cycle through proven track 
record including years of experience and indication of volume of Open-Source projects 
supported. 
The Commission considers that proposals in this topic with an overall duration of typically 36 
months would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not 
preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other durations.  
In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and 
innovation content is not a mandatory requirement. 
Financial support to third parties  
Third parties will be funded through projects typically in the EUR 50 000 to 150 000 range 
per project, with indicative duration of 9 to 12 months. The consortium should provide the 
programme logic for the third-party projects, managing the projects lifecycle, and provide the 
necessary technical and non-technical support: these tasks cannot be implemented using the 
budget earmarked for the financial support to third parties.

conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
In order to achieve the expected outcomes, and safeguard the Union’s 
strategic assets, interests, autonomy, and security, it is important to avoid 
a situation of technological dependency on a non-EU source, in a global 
context that requires the EU to take action to build on its strengths, and to 
carefully assess and address any strategic weaknesses, vulnerabilities and 
high-risk dependencies which put at risk the attainment of its ambitions. 
For this reason, participation is limited to legal entities established in 
Member States, Iceland and Norway, associated countries, OECD 
countries and MERCOSUR countries. 
For the duly justified and exceptional reasons listed in the paragraph 
above, in order to guarantee the protection of the strategic interests of the 
Union and its Member States, entities established in an eligible country 
listed above, but which are directly or indirectly controlled by a non-
eligible country or by a non-eligible country entity, shall not participate in 
the action. 
 
Expected Outcome: Defining specific R&I roadmap at EU level to enhance the cooperation 
between the EU authorities and other stakeholders and establish leadership in all relevant 
submarine cable technology domains (EU research roadmap on submarine cables 
infrastructures, i.e. including any infrastructure related to its construction, operation, 
maintenance and repair). This CSA should be prepared, managed and coordinated by the key 
stakeholders in this field, including industry, research and academic stakeholders. 
Τhe project should take into consideration the overarching challenges of: 
• Reinforcing European leadership and cooperation in submarine cable connectivity, with 
European capabilities and best practices shaping future connectivity standards, 
promoting their secondary use (e.g. for a pre-warning system of natural hazard) as well 
as synergies and collaboration with CEF-Digital backbone projects; 
• A digital and green transition towards low carbon footprint of connectivity platforms 
through principles of the circular economy, including reduction of pollution, 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 125 of 339 
regenerating natural systems etc. while targeting long-term sustainability, resilience and 
security of submarine cable networks; 
• Ensuring resilience for the most demanding cases requiring a very high grade of quality 
of service (QoS) and performances, and 
• Risk evaluation, preparedness and prevention against any future natural or man-made 
damage or deliberate sabotage.  
Against this background, the objectives of the target support actions are outlined below: 
• Analysis and definition of the expected critical hardware and software components of 
future submarine cable infrastructure systems, and indication on where Europe should 
seize opportunities and strengthen its capabilities, taking into account the characteristics 
and architectures, including components, security, and operations of future submarine 
connectivity infrastructures; 
• Definition of the main required R&I work and assessment of associated research 
investment needs related to the identified domains; 
• Definition of an appropriate industry roadmap (SRIA), in close partnership with relevant 
EU actors both from industry and academia, indicating research & innovation actions to 
be undertaken in priority, their scope, and a timetable showing the main milestones and 
targets. The project could envisage organising thematic workshops to consult all 
interested communities. The results of this action will feed into the work of relevant 
groups working on submarine cable infrastructures, such as the European Submarine 
Cable Expert Group, the NIS 2 Coordination Group or the CER Group.  
Scope:  
• Enabling technologies applicable to submarine connectivity infrastructures and systems, 
including its secondary use for pre-warning systems against natural hazards, are 
increasingly important to ensure Europe’s strategic autonomy as well as economic 
security. Achieving such goals requires that Europe remains at the technological edge 
not only with regards to the cable technology itself but also all the other critical elements 
composing the submarine cable infrastructure such as repeaters, landings stations, 
operational control centres, underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASN) or cable 
communications cybersecurity. 
• While some of the necessary research is indirectly conducted through mainstream 
research activities in generic technologies (e.g., optical communications or network 
management software), more specific research is needed to address the particular needs 
and advancement of submarine cable infrastructures and systems. However, the specific 
research needs still need to be identified, which supports the need to develop a specific 
roadmap and SRIA for research and innovation in submarine cable technologies. Such 
research efforts may address some of the following (non-exhaustive) domains: Multi-
core fibre (MCF) technology, Digital Signal Processing, repeater systems, intelligent

sensing, advanced Digital Acoustic Sensing (DAS), strain and temperature sensing, 
oceanographic sensors for continuous, real-time trans-oceanic measurements (monitor 
water body), logical layer and cable network management systems, underwater robotics 
to improve the construction, maintenance and repair of submarine cable infrastructures, 
and other innovations, such as wireless sensor networks (WSN) to monitor permanently 
submarine cable infrastructure and to detect possible threats.  
Projects are expected to develop synergies and ensure complementarities with projects under 
CEF Digital, the Digital Europe Programme (DEP) and the Smart Networks and Services 
(SNS) Joint Undertaking.

Expected Outcome: The projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes: 
• Easing the compliance process of businesses and professionals with the relevant EU 
legislation, in particular reporting obligations, and alleviating administrative burdens for 
businesses and professionals. 
• Developing and integrating advanced technologies for data collection, data sharing and 
data analytics for simplifying and automating compliance. 
• Generating, managing, and leveraging synthetic data to improve fitness for purpose; 
addressing limitations of real-world data, enhancing data quality, diversity, and 
representativeness, while mitigating bias and addressing other ethical issues. 
• Ensuring broad user training and support for rolling out and scaling up “compliance and 
privacy by design” and the FAIR150 principles in the constantly evolving regulatory 
landscape.  
Scope: As the European Union (EU) legislation continues to expand, both in the digital 
(GDPR, Open Data Directive (ODD), Data Governance Act, AI Act, Data Act) and non-
digital realm (e.g. green deal, due diligence, healthcare, transport), businesses and 
professionals face increasing challenges in maintaining compliance. Also, the complexity and 
volume of reporting obligations are growing, posing difficulties for both regulatory bodies to 
enforce laws and for entities trying to comply. These challenges underscore the need for 
innovative solutions to streamline compliance processes and enhance competitiveness within 
the EU. 
Another current challenge are limitations of real-world data such as issues with availability, 
confidentiality, and bias. Synthetic data is becoming increasingly vital in addressing these 
problems. By generating and utilizing synthetic data, actions within this framework aim to 
enhance data quality, diversity, and representativeness, making it a crucial tool for AI-
powered innovation and regulatory compliance. 
Where relevant, the actions should address cybersecurity, interoperability, reproducibility 
and standardization, and/or liaise with other actions working on those aspects, in view of 
 
150 
FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable data 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 128 of 339 
facilitating effective data sharing across platforms and sectors, while ensuring an adequate 
level of security and protection. 
Actions should provide necessary comprehensive user training and support, (also involving 
the users/stakeholders outside the project), ensuring adaptability and scalability to 
accommodate evolving regulations and diverse organizational needs and to raise awareness 
and improve understanding of relevant compliance issues. Proposals for all three areas should 
analyse and address the real needs of real users and stakeholders, and how these will be 
addressed in the proposed action. The training and user needs should be linked to tangible 
progress indicators in the proposal. 
The proposal should clearly state (in the abstract and in the introduction) which of the 
following three areas it addresses. A proposal can address more than one area, but it should 
indicate one of them as the main focus of the proposal, and it will be evaluated accordingly 
under that area. 
• Area 1: Actions to develop advanced compliance technology integrating AI, 
cybersecurity, language technologies, and privacy preservation. This framework could 
include the creation of NLP151-driven semantic analysis tools for deciphering complex 
legal texts and translating them into clear compliance tasks, energy-efficient 
neuromorphic approaches and mechanisms for optimising massive data operations, or 
machine learning algorithms trained on historical data to predict and mitigate potential 
compliance violations. With the capability to detect changes in EU legislation, these 
advanced AI systems and analytics tools will provide deep insights into compliance 
performance, risk management, and help forecast upcoming regulatory trends to 
strategically prepare for future requirements. For usability, it is also important that the 
tools can be integrated with the organisation’s existing processes and systems. 
• Area 2: Actions to ensure auto-compliance of data transactions and data spaces with 
applicable regulation (e.g. data and sectoral legislation). Actions in this area should 
anticipate compliance tasks within the context of Common European Data Spaces and 
coordinate with them as necessary. Actions in this area are expected to develop 
automatic or semi-automatic tools that analyse and take into account the specific 
architecture, governance model, exchange mechanisms, tools, data types, identity 
management, smart contracting, user policies and other user needs or operational 
features of the actual data spaces, liaising with and building on other actions working in 
this area, in particular the Data Spaces Support Centre. 
• Area 3: Actions to generate, manage and leverage synthetic data in order to improve data 
quality, availability, representativity, fitness for purpose and compliance. The actions 
should in particular address the inherent shortcomings of real world data that would 
necessitate synthetic data (e.g. data availability, confidentiality, privacy protection, 
enhancing quality, diversity, representativeness, bias). Additionally, actions may target 
generating synthetic data for sparse or unusual domains, integrating synthetic and real

data effectively, or advancing technological capabilities in generative models and 
simulation-based approaches to drive synthetic data generation forward and/or 
addressing or modelling rare events and complex dynamic systems. All actions under 
this Area are expected to address the evaluation, validation and benchmarking of 
synthetic data to ensure fitness for purpose and safe, ethical and compliant use of 
synthetic data, including the analysis and mitigation of biases inherited from the original 
data or introduced by the synthetic data generation process. For these purposes, 
collaboration with simulation/digital twins actions could be explored.  
This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, Data and Robotics. 
Projects are expected to develop synergies with Digital Europe programme topics 
implementing Common European Data Spaces, especially the Data Spaces Support Centre 
(DSSC). Projects are expected to ensure complementarities with projects funded under the 
following topics: 
• HORIZON-CL4-2024-DATA-01-01 AI-driven data operations and compliance 
technologies (IA).

• Seamless and trustworthy integration and interoperability across diverse computing and 
data environments spanning from core cloud (including HPC) to edge to IoT and across 
different technology stacks. 
• Enhanced openness and open strategic autonomy in the evolving data and AI-economies 
across the computing continuum validated through key business/societal sectors. 
• Guaranteeing a minimum level of interoperability and portability thereby facilitating 
European access to foreign markets.  
Scope: The Cloud to Edge Continuum needs to provide seamless and trustworthy integration 
of diverse computing and data environments spanning from core cloud to edge to IoT and 
support the enormous data, processing needs, and new resource types brought by next 
generation AI technologies. 
Different types of AI processes pose different requirements that compute infrastructures need 
to meet to execute them. The state-of-the-art in generative AI and large language models is 
heavily reliant on high-performance processing and very large AI models. Cutting-edge 
hardware accelerators that power these processing systems are scarce on the market and only 
available in highly specialised, high-performance infrastructures in certain cloud and HPC 
environments at considerable costs. At the same time, the requirement to gather, process, and 
transmit massive amounts of data to the central data processing environment remains a barrier 
for many AI applications. All these factors urge the emergence of efficient tools and 
mechanisms to empower the distribution of AI training and inference processes 
throughout the computing continuum. 
Empowering the next generation AI technologies with on-demand, agile and situation-aware 
infrastructure that brings data- and computing power to where and when it is needed will let 
end-users exploit Artificial Intelligence across the computing continuum without 
compromising on security and trust and optimising their energy use. These challenges span 
various aspects of the continuum, including on-device data processing, data orchestration 
and sharing, AI integration, decentralised intelligent management, decentralized and 
global optimization, energy and resource heterogeneity support, data management, 
security/privacy, and synergies with 5G/6G. Addressing these challenges is crucial for 
realizing the vision of a cognitive cloud-to-edge continuum as a key enabler for any emerging 
trends such as AI/generative AI. 
The Cognitive Computing Continuum could eventually be extended to include other 
computational resources, such as HPC, and provide abstraction layers to maximize the 
benefits of available hardware. 
Addressing all the above complexities calls for innovative research to overcome these 
challenges. The aim is to develop generic and AI-enabled cloud-edge technologies 
encompassing the whole computing continuum to empower the development of 
AI/generative AI technologies and applications. The proposals should demonstrate the 
generic applicability of the proposed technological solutions across various application 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 132 of 339 
domains such as but not limited to, manufacturing, healthcare, robotics, transportation and 
smart cities. 
The following (one or more) research areas should be addressed: 
• Development of novel mechanisms for the efficient development, deployment, and 
operation of AI workflows across heterogeneous and distributed infrastructures along 
the Edge to Cloud to HPC continuum that optimise training times, model accuracy and 
data management while factoring in performance metrics such as memory usage, energy 
efficiency, application processing and data transfer latency, and network overheads. 
These should factor in virtualisation and orchestration techniques that seamlessly 
integrate heterogeneous processor architectures and cater for the explainability of the 
applied cognitive optimisations. 
• Decentralised and federated computing continuum tools and mechanisms to enable 
distributed AI architectures. These include scheduling, orchestration, and placement 
mechanisms that leverage the wide range of Edge computing environments available in 
the compute continuum, including on-device edge. Tools and mechanisms should take 
into consideration - where appropriate - data security and privacy aspects. The focus is 
on enhancing AI process execution through techniques such as model, data, hybrid 
parallelism and data compression, gossip, swarm, and federated training, or conditional 
computing. 
• Cloud and edge processing tools and techniques to reduce AI processing power 
usage and emissions across the cognitive computing continuum, relying on hardware 
efficiency (for example, thanks to special-purpose accelerators and heterogeneous 
hardware processor architectures) and energy optimisation techniques, such as hardware 
and software approximation.  
This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, Data, and Robotics. 
Projects are expected to develop synergies and relate to activities and outcomes of the Digital 
Europe Programme (DEP) and any existing or emerging Important Projects of Common 
European Interest (IPCEI) initiative, such as IPCEI-CIS. 
All proposals are expected to share communicable results with the European R&D 
community, through the AI-on-demand platform, and if necessary other relevant digital 
resource platforms in order to enhance the European AI, Data and Robotics ecosystem 
through the sharing of results and best practice.

• New concepts of the auto-evolution-enabled software elements that AI algorithms can 
autonomously select and integrate.  
Scope: The latest developments in AI are demanding computation infrastructures designed to 
maximize the number of FLOPS. Europe has a window of opportunity to leverage open 
source and ensure that the European industry is at the cutting edge of these new processing 
infrastructures. The current methods and tools to develop and efficiently deliver AI pipelines 
and complex generative AI applications present several shortcomings. 
Current identified challenges include the continuous management of data pipelines, novel 
testing methods (e.g. differential testing or improved performance testing), optimized 
deployment strategies (in terms of using energy efficient resources or the best performant), 
management of dependencies with a diverse set of types of hardware, algorithm bias and 
discrimination against certain groups, determined by characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, 
age or disability, as well as the maintenance of the effectiveness of AI applications, notably 
generative AI ones. The explainability of AI models is another crucial challenge that must be 
also tackled at the software engineering level, possibly in synergy with explainability methods 
at the machine learning stage. Also, large language models and foundational models require 
the development and operation of complex system architectures that need to handle data 
processing at large scale, continuous training of models and inference. Furthermore, AI 
pipelines and generative AI application also strongly suffer from poor protection against 
learning dataset poisoning, as well as prompt poisoning; software engineering methods and 
tools providing support to protect against those attacks are thus direly required. This presents 
novel challenges for developers that will need to be addressed with the development of new 
methods, mechanisms and tools covering the above, including neuromorphic computing, but 
not limited to. 
The main objectives for the advancements of Software Engineering in this field are: 
• Increasing the productivity of generative AI application developers, and operators, 
especially of foundational and language models. 
• Define a reference architecture and framework for generative AI application developers 
to simplify integration and system modularity. 
• Simplifying and automating the development and operation of such applications.

Destination 4: Achieving open strategic autonomy in digital and emerging enabling 
technologies 
Destination 4 ensures Europe’s strategic autonomy while preserving an open economy in 
those technologies that will be key for a deep digital transformation of industry, public 
services and society, while fully playing its enabling role in the twin transition. As set out in 
the European Chips Act, the top-priorities are to i) strengthen processes undertaken at critical 
stages in the semiconductor and quantum chips value chain, including chip design and 
manufacturing technologies, and ii) address the use of new materials and green technologies, 
energy efficiency and the integration of circularity and life-cycle assessment. 
Destination 4 will address high value-added hardware needs for core, cloud and edge, fast-
sensing, low-latency and high-bandwidth data transmission, and help secure the supply of 
critical components for key markets, such as automotive, health, automation and mobility 
systems. For this purpose, significant human capacity will be required in chip manufacturing 
to ensure: (i) the strengthening of processes undertaken at critical stages in the value chain; 
and (ii) that workers can take up quality jobs created as part of these priorities, including 
through the activities undertaken by the joint undertaking initiative. 
In addition, future needs in microelectronics (such as performance, size, cost, energy 
efficiency, environmental impact, new materials, concepts, architectures, integration) may 
also be addressed to make sure Europe’s microelectronics industry remains competitive. 
Opportunities may come from non-volatile memories, spintronics, in-memory computing, 
neuromorphic and other emerging technologies. Photonics research will lead to fast and 
versatile sensing and imaging, and energy-efficient building blocks for networks and data 
centres. The cluster will also push for chip-level integration of photonics and optoelectronics. 
The cloud/edge/internet of things will be transformed into an agile and situation-aware 
infrastructure that brings data to where and when it is needed. Within these smart digital 
infrastructures, end-to-end artificial intelligence, from the core to the edge and across all 
technology layers, will be key for on-demand supply of optimal data-, communication-, and 
computing resource orchestration, with optimal use of energy while preserving privacy and 
ensuring resilience. European sovereignty in the cloud-edge server market will be 
strengthened through the power of open-source software, complementing the RISC-V based 
European Processor Initiative that aims to increase Europe’s independence in high 
performance computing hardware. 
Cluster 4 will transform the user experience. It will push the frontiers of virtual and extended 
realities (VR/XR) and of open, human-centric virtual worlds for industry, entertainment and 
arts, public services and people alike, e.g. by leveraging social innovation. It envisages a 
vibrant R&I ecosystem that strategically joins-up research and development on sophisticated 
VR/XR optics and displays, multimodal human-computer interaction, authoring tools, real-
time spatial computing, rendering, integration and application research. Improved sensing, 
fast processing and low-latency will be challenging for the underlying cloud/edge/Internet of 
things. Along similar lines, the way in which the virtual world meets the physical world will 
continue to evolve, thanks to all kinds of robots and other smart devices that involve self- and 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 138 of 339 
context awareness, spatial intelligence, exploiting the best in bias-free AI, engineering and 
design for game-changing physical characteristics, functional or cognitive capabilities, acute 
perception, autonomy and safe interaction. 
Artificial intelligence underpins many of these changes and Cluster 4 will strengthen and 
consolidate R&I in this area. For example, today’s generative models are a preview of how 
virtual worlds and multimodal user-experiences could be produced on-demand. Research on 
core learning and analysis techniques (incremental, frugal and collaborative), as well as next 
generation smart robotic systems, will keep Europe at the cutting edge of AI. Artificial 
Intelligence is also key to keep the competitiveness and strategic autonomy of the EU 
scientific sector. The EU's comprehensive approach to achieving leadership in AI is reflected 
in its Apply AI Strategy, which aims at establishing Europe as a global leader in the 
development and adoption of AI. By fostering a vibrant AI ecosystem, the EU seeks to make 
Europe a hub for AI innovation and growth, where world-class AI models are developed and 
integrated into strategic sectors. This initiative is designed to drive innovation, economic 
growth, and competitiveness, while ensuring that the benefits of AI are shared by all. The 
topics related to Generative AI included in this destination will support the implementation of 
the GenAI4EU initiative included in the AI Innovation Package of 24 January 2024. They 
constitute, moreover, an integral part of the broader Apply AI strategy. By aligning these 
efforts with the GenAI4EU initiative and the Apply AI strategy, the EU aims to create a 
cohesive and coordinated approach to AI development and adoption, one that promotes 
European excellence and leadership in this critical field. 
Europe’s long-term competitiveness in the digital area requires continuous scouting and early, 
low-TRL cross-disciplinary work on new and emerging technologies, dissociated from the 
main roadmaps. This would encourage collaboration in research and cross-fertilisation 
between disciplines and sectors on new approaches in: (i) microelectronics; (ii) power 
electronics; (iii) photonics and photon/phonon/spin/electron integration; (iv) unconventional, 
hybrid, neuromorphic, nature-inspired or bio-intelligent paradigms; and (v) novel systems and 
infrastructure architectures. 
Europe’s strength in quantum technologies (including in quantum communications and 
optical satellite communications, etc.) is a strategic asset for its future security and 
independence. Cluster 4 supports early and mature quantum technologies and stimulates their 
industrial uptake, e.g. through experimentation and testing environments for integrating them 
into standard industrial design and manufacturing. Equally transformative, two-dimensional 
materials (2DM) could positively affect many industries, including ICT. While further 
exploring the vast range of 2DMs, Cluster 4 will also work towards completing a fully 
European supply chain and scaling up the development and piloting of 2DM technologies and 
devices for more industrial fields.

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 152 of 339 
Scope: Fabless semiconductor start-ups and SMEs play a key role in driving innovation and 
economic growth within the global technology sector. These companies, which design chips 
and outsource their manufacturing, are at the forefront of technological advancements, fueling 
innovative developments in semiconductor technologies related to AI, data processing, 
communications, automotive, and more. Globally, fabless companies contribute to 
approximately 50% of chip revenues. However, Europe’s share in this crucial market is less 
than 1%, highlighting a significant gap that needs to be addressed to strengthen Europe’s 
strategic autonomy and economic security. European fabless startups and SMEs often face 
significant challenges in accessing cohesive and timely information, financial resources, and 
relevant infrastructures and services. Nurturing and supporting the growth of European 
fabless SMEs is essential for building a competitive ecosystem that fosters rapid innovation, 
job creation, and sustainable growth. This Coordination and Support Action (CSA) aims to 
bridge this gap by providing targeted support and advocacy for Europe’s fabless 
semiconductor start-ups, SMEs and small mid-caps, ensuring their voice is heard and their 
potential is fully realized. 
The CSA will support European fabless start-ups, SMEs and mid-caps by establishing a 
coordination and knowledge hub to foster collaboration, improve access to strategic resources, 
and bridge the gap between them and decision-making entities. The proposed actions will aim 
to: 
• Establish a sustainable organization or network, potentially through the formation of an 
open industry association, to represent the interests of European fabless SMEs. 
• Promote dialogue and advocacy between fabless SMEs and European stakeholders, 
including public authorities and policymakers, while representing their interests with key 
industrial actors (such as foundries, EDA vendors, and design houses) as well as relevant 
initiatives of the Chips for Europe Initiative, the Chips Joint Undertaking and the IPCEIs 
on Microelectronics.  
• Enhance the visibility and engagement of fabless start-ups and SMEs in EU policy-
making to leverage their innovation potential, strengthening Europe’s leadership in 
critical industry domains and in advanced semiconductors such as for AI, HPC, 
quantum, communications, advanced sensing, power systems and autonomous driving 
technologies and applications. 
• Align with relevant support actions in key EU programmes, including coordination with 
the network of the European Semiconductor Competence Centres and the Design 
Platform under the "Chips for Europe Initiative". 
• Develop a central platform (a one stop-shop) for semiconductor start-ups and SMEs that 
aggregates and disseminates all essential information they need (e.g., policy updates, 
public and private funding opportunities, and technological advancements) and 
facilitates access to funding and investment opportunities. 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025

• Organize and participate in events, including workshops and conferences, to enhance the 
profile of fabless startups and SMEs, and strengthen their role in the broader European 
semiconductor ecosystem. 
• Foster partnerships and innovation through networks that connect start-ups and SMEs, 
promoting cross-sector knowledge-sharing and joint projects to advance technological 
solutions and business growth.  
The action should be coordinated and driven by the relevant representative European start-up 
and SME stakeholders operating in the field.

• Significantly improved facilitation of product and process certification and compliance 
assessment, as well as reliability, efficiency and sustainability of manufacturing 
processes, supporting easier high-mix production and manufacturing of products based 
on sustainable and advanced technologies; and 
• Significantly facilitated installation, commissioning and decommissioning of production 
facilities, through tools that enable faster industrialisation of factory automation well 
beyond the pilot phase, while reducing the need for manual on-site interventions. 
• Applicants will justify their selection by the expected business dimension of their use 
cases, while ensuring a critical mass of resources in the project to ensure significant 
outcomes in these.  
Scope: Proposals integrating Generative AI in robotics and industrial automation are expected 
to substantially contribute to productivity gains, including for instance in engineering 
industries, the automotive sector, food production or other sectors related to manufacturing 
industries. All proposals will have to demonstrate their expected impact on the 
competitiveness of the selected application sector. 
The budget will be split in a balanced way between area Type A and Type B defined below. 
Proposals should clearly identify the area they are addressing. 
Proposals aiming for Type A outcomes should adhere to the Type A scope, while proposals 
aiming for Type B outcomes should follow the Type B scope. 
Type A Scope: While it is widely acknowledged that current use of generative AI has the 
potential to impact certain tasks in robotics such as improving user interaction or providing 
explanations about why a robot system made a particular decision, these are, in general, not 
within the critical operating flow of a robot. To reach next level of autonomy, generative AI 
must also enable robots to learn from their experiences, simulate realistic environments for 
training in challenging conditions, and enhance planning, decision making and control while 
considering the physical constraints imposed both by the environment and by the physical 
construction of the robot. This includes integrating 'Human-in-the-loop' mechanisms, where 
AI systems collaborate with human operators to enhance decision-making processes and 
adaptability, particularly in dynamic environments. 
This represents a significant advancement in robotics, requiring the development of AI 
models that can effectively navigate the complexities of the physical world while ensuring 
safety. Generative AI is expecting to bring such a step-change in robots precision, 
adaptability, versatility and robustness, enabling them to efficiently achieve real world tasks 
such as complex moves (navigation, manipulations, etc.) with higher level of autonomy and 
precision. 
In the context of advancing robotics capabilities, the use of generative AI stands as a 
transformative force, amplifying robots’ learning, interaction, and operational abilities. By 
enabling robots to learn from experiences, simulate diverse environments for training, and 
enhance human-robot interaction, it drives adaptability and efficiency. Additionally, 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 157 of 339 
generative AI facilitates the augmentation of robot situational awareness and planning 
capabilities, empowering them to predict outcomes of various actions, thereby elevating their 
autonomy and decision-making prowess. 
Training current generative AI models, in particular Large AI models, requires high volumes 
of data to achieve effective levels of performance. The vast amount of data required present a 
significant challenge when it comes to robotics. Further research is necessary to find the 
appropriate balance between the quality, adequacy, and volume of data with regards to the 
performance of the AI model. Moreover, model distillation techniques may play a key role for 
the portability of the generative AI solution at the edge, in power-limited devices. The 
training data should come from the real world or from physical aware simulations of the real 
world. Where relevant, in particular in the context of human interaction, training data should 
encompass diverse individual characteristics, such as gender, age, racial and ethnical 
background, to mitigate potential bias and discriminations. 
Proposals should detail strategies to leverage cutting-edge generative AI techniques to 
enhance the adaptability and reliability of these models across complex and dynamic 
scenarios, as well as how to ensure human-centricity and environmental considerations. The 
goal is to train and fine-tune generative AI models that meet the necessary standards for 
ensuring the safe operation of robotics hardware. These models should empower robots to 
autonomously plan and execute actions while maintaining high levels of performance and 
generalization capabilities. 
Research activities should explore the training methodologies for these foundation models, 
emphasizing their ability to process multimodal data and derive actionable insights to inform 
robotic decision-making processes. 
The proposals are also expected to include the validation of the trained models through 
applications. Proposals should detail methodologies for conducting rigorous testing 
procedures, incorporating both simulation-based evaluations and physical experiments. These 
tests aim to evaluate the performance and scalability of developed foundation models. 
The research will be driven by impactful scenarios defined by major manufacturing industry 
players who should be well integrated in the consortium. They should be deeply involved in 
the proposed work in order to provide the use-case, the corresponding data and they will play 
an important role to accompany the validation process. They will define a number of 
representative real-world use-cases with gradually increased level of complexity to drive the 
technology development. They will provide existing relevant data and collect further data 
necessary to train and fine-tune the models, but also to validate the solutions. Given the 
sensitivity of sharing industrial data, manufacturers present in the consortium have to define 
upfront mechanisms to collectively provide and pool a sufficiently large dataset for training 
the models (this might involve a trusted third party as intermediary), ensuring sufficient 
quality and quantity of data needed to train the models. If necessary, they will have to put in 
place mechanisms to acquire data from sources outside the consortium. 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 158 of 339 
Proposals are expected to enhance the accuracy and robustness of generative AI systems in 
robotics, ensuring that the solutions developed are trustworthy and reliable in their 
applications, hence in line with the AI Act requirements. 
Proposals should address both the safety of robotic operations, ensuring protection against 
physical risks, and cybersecurity measures to safeguard against digital threats and ensure 
system integrity. 
The emphasis lies in creating and disseminating general-purpose models and tools rather than 
being limited to narrowly focused solutions. Projects should also build on or seek 
collaboration with existing and upcoming projects and develop synergies and ensure 
complementarities with other relevant European (e.g. projects funded under HORIZON-CL4-
2024-HUMAN-03-01: Advancing Large AI Models: Integration of New Data Modalities and 
Expansion of Capabilities), national or regional initiatives, funding programmes and 
platforms. 
Type B Scope: 
The objective is to enhance productivity and provide a competitive advantage to EU industry 
in the transition towards more sustainable, zero-carbon production, addressing the 
uncertainties and tensions on supply chains and the lack of highly-skilled workers. A new 
generation of digital technologies will integrate generative Artificial Intelligence, robotics, 
and advanced human interfaces in industry-grade applications with a high degree of 
autonomy. This will enable the development, production, and operation of complex and 
advanced high-tech products at lower cost while improving sustainability and flexibility, 
ultimately becoming a powerful tool for accelerating innovation in both processes and 
products. 
The manufacturing sector should strongly benefit from increased levels of automation made 
possible by breakthroughs provided by AI, in particular by the family of technologies know as 
generative AI, including (e.g.) AI foundation models, large language models, transformers, 
multimodal generative AI. The main objective of this Type B is the development of 
Generative AI solutions dedicated to the manufacturing sector and making use of 
manufacturing data available in production lines. 
Proposals should address at least one of the following use-cases: 
1) Robustness and trustworthiness of digital technologies and data management at industry-
grade quality, to raise the automation levels on production sites and across industry and 
supply chains; 
2) Enhanced product and process qualification/certification and compliance assessment 
through higher levels of automation, digitalisation and data management, taking into account 
related requirements; 
3) Automation of manufacturing processes to achieve higher reliability, efficiency and 
sustainability; 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 159 of 339 
4) Automated tools for fast and large-scale deployment and reconfiguration of production 
assets and for rapid innovation cycles. 
Proposals should accomplish these objectives exploiting the most suitable approach(es) 
among the ones described below: 
• The integration of applications exhibiting advanced developments of generative AI 
model(s) specifically designed for manufacturing, providing measurable advantages in 
one of more of these key areas: manufacturing cost, increased productivity, quality, 
flexibility, resilience, sustainability, circularity, time to market and usability. 
Applications can target factory-floor operations and/or management of data, knowledge 
and documentation associated to products and production (for use-case 1 or 2); 
• Development and integration of digital production systems capable of significantly 
increasing productivity and managing high-mix production with close to zero time 
needed for re-purposing and capability to manage different mixes of materials and 
components (for use-case 3); 
• Development of deployment tools to automate the management of production lines, 
namely through automatic configuration, integration with legacy systems, placement of 
data translators and connectors, and deployment of machines and sensors on the shop 
floor (for use-case 4).  
Proposals should indicate which approach they are targeting. Proposals may combine several 
approaches above, indicating which is the main approach, provided there is added value in 
such a combined approach; arbitrary combinations without integration are excluded. 
The use of generative AI techniques is encouraged for all the approaches. The applicants will 
specifically describe how they will secure the acquisition of quality manufacturing data from 
real-world industrial use cases of industry partners or companies outside the consortium in the 
context of the data volume necessary to train and finetune the models used in the proposal. 
Type A and Type B 
For both Type A and Type B projects, proposal should allocate up to EUR 30 million towards 
the development of the foundation model. Each project is anticipated to focus on up to six use 
cases. 
A minimum of EUR 10 million of the proposal budget must be allocated via FSTP for the 
fine-tuning phase. This phase aims to create Generative AI applications tailored to impactful 
industry-driven use cases. 
• FSTP may be foreseen for up to EUR 2 million per use case, either for a single company 
(including SME/Start-up), user industry providing their data and use-case, or to a small 
consortium complementing such user industry company with one or two additional 
partners, such as AI developer/integrator. Such FSTP initiatives will develop mini-
projects, working in close collaboration with the consortium partners, that will dedicate 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 160 of 339 
sufficient resources to support such FSTP projects, in order to develop advanced 
applications and demonstrate with quantitative KPIs the power of Generative AI 
solutions. These mini-projects will include data preparation, fine-tuning, validation of 
the Generative AI solution in the selected impactful use-cases.  
Proposed projects should aim to develop models that align with European values and 
principles and regulation, including the AI Act. Research should build on existing standards 
or contribute to standardisation, particularly addressing the needs and requirements of the 
industry. 
Where relevant, interoperability for data sharing should be addressed, focusing on open 
specifications and standards, enabling effective cross-domain data communities, and new 
data-driven markets. 
If high computing resources are necessary, for both Type A and Type B proposals the primary 
source of computing resources for pretraining should be sought from external high-
performance computing facilities such as EuroHPC or National centres. The proposal should 
describe convincingly the strategy to access these computing resources. 
When possible, proposals should build on and reuse public results from relevant previous 
funded actions. Additionally, proposals should leverage the tools available for the AI and 
robotics community on the AI on demand platform. Communicable results should be shared 
with the European R&D community through the AI-on-demand platform, and if necessary, 
other relevant digital resource platforms to bolster the European AI, Data, and Robotics 
ecosystem by disseminating results and best practices. 
This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnerships on AI, Data, and Robotic 
(ADRA) and Made in Europe and all proposals are expected to allocate tasks for cohesion 
activities with ADRA and the CSA HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-HUMAN-18: GenAI4EU 
central Hub. 
Proposals should also build on or seek collaboration with existing projects and develop 
synergies with other relevant International, European, national or regional initiatives.

conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
In order to achieve the expected outcomes, and safeguard the Union’s 
strategic assets, interests, autonomy, and security, it is important to 
avoid a situation of technological dependency on a non-EU source, in a 
global context that requires the EU to take action to build on its 
strengths, and to carefully assess and address any strategic weaknesses, 
vulnerabilities and high-risk dependencies which put at risk the 
attainment of its ambitions. For this reason, participation is limited to 
legal entities established in Member States, Iceland and Norway and the 
following additional associated countries: Canada, Israel, the Republic 
of Korea, New Zealand, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. 
For the duly justified and exceptional reasons listed in the paragraph 
above, in order to guarantee the protection of the strategic interests of 
the Union and its Member States, entities established in an eligible 
country listed above, but which are directly or indirectly controlled by a 
non-eligible country or by a non-eligible country entity, may not 
participate in the action unless it can be demonstrated, by means of 
guarantees positively assessed by their eligible country of establishment, 
that their participation to the action would not negatively impact the 
Union’s strategic assets, interests, autonomy, or security. Entities 
assessed as high-risk suppliers of mobile network communication 
equipment within the meaning of ‘restrictions for the protection of 
European communication networks’ (or entities fully or partially owned 
or controlled by a high-risk supplier) cannot submit guarantees.157

The guarantees shall in particular substantiate that, for the purpose of the action, measures are in place 
to ensure that: a) control over the applicant legal entity is not exercised in a manner that retrains or 
restricts its ability to carry out the action and to deliver results, that imposes restrictions concerning its 
infrastructure, facilities, assets, resources, intellectual property or know-how needed for the purpose of 
the action, or that undermines its capabilities and standards necessary to carry out the action; b) access 
by a non-eligible country or by a non-eligible country entity to sensitive information relating to the 
action is prevented; and the employees or other persons involved in the action have a national security 
clearance issued by an eligible country, where appropriate; c) ownership of the intellectual property 
arising from, and the results of, the action remain within the recipient during and after completion of the 
action, are not subject to control or restrictions by non-eligible countries or non-eligible country entity, 
and are not exported outside the eligible countries, nor is access to them from outside the eligible

grants will be awarded to applications not only in order of ranking but at 
least also to one proposal that is the highest ranked within (i) the 
aerospace sector, (ii) the pharma/drug development sector, and (iii) the 
telecommunication sector, provided that the applications attain all 
thresholds. 
Legal and 
financial set-up of 
the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Grants awarded under this topic will be linked to the other actions 
granted under this topic. A collaboration agreement will required.  
Beneficiaries must provide financial support to third parties. The support 
to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants. In derogation 
to article 208 EU Financial Regulation, the maximum amount to be 
granted to each third party can exceed EUR 60,000 and reach up to EUR 
250 000 per competing solution. This derogation is justified by the 
substantial resources required to successfully carry out the challenges 
planned in the project in the stage 2, that should be substantiated in the 
proposals. This amount is granted at the end of the first stage of the 
challenge to the 20 winning solutions, as a grant to prepare for the stage 
2 of the challenge.  
Each competing solution to be developed in stage 2 is proposed either 
by a single start-up/SME or a small team of organisations built around 
such start-up/SME, therefore the EUR 250 000 is distributed 
accordingly. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Significant technology progress and innovation through challenge-driven approach in the 
fields of aerospace, pharma/drug development or telecommunication networks. 
• Increased competitivity and visibility of the Generative AI community in Europe, in 
demonstrating their capability to achieve challenging tasks within the aerospace, 
pharma/drug development or telecommunication sectors. 
• Increased adoption of Generative AI in aerospace, pharma/drug development or 
telecommunication networks through tangible progress and achievement demonstrated 
via the challenge-driven process.   
Scope: Generative AI (GenAI) promises to transform most industry sectors. This challenge-
driven initiative aims to boost both Europe’s developer community and the adoption of 
powerful trustworthy generative AI solutions in the strategic sectors of aerospace, 
pharma/drugs and telecommunication networks, key for their competitiveness. In 
pharmaceuticals, it can, for instance, accelerates drug design by rapidly creating target-

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 163 of 339 
specific molecules, reducing development time from years to seconds, and potentially 
preventing prolonged health crises like COVID-19. In aerospace, generative AI can for 
instance optimize aircraft design, streamline manufacturing processes, predict maintenance 
needs through sensor data analysis, route optimisation, and enhance pilot training with 
diverse, realistic simulations. By embracing generative AI, telecom companies can position 
themselves at the forefront of a new era of intelligent and automated telecommunications. 
Specific use-cases include for instance network management, network optimization, network 
slicing, network healing, predictive maintenance, network mapping and optimization. 
Each proposal should focus exclusively on one of the three key sectors mentioned above: 
aerospace, pharma/drug development, or telecommunications and clearly specify which sector 
it addresses. Each proposal is expected to focus primarily on the definition, the organization 
of a multi-stage competition in the chosen sector, as well as the accompanying support to the 
companies/teams taking part in the challenges, and related activities to maximise the impact 
of the action. 
User industry companies from the strategic sector targeted by the proposal should be core 
partners in the consortium. They should demonstrate a genuine interest in the projects results 
and therefore support the challenge participants - in order to reach the most powerful and 
exploitable results benefitting their industry. The expected results are pre-competitive but the 
proposal must include a draft exploitation plan outlining commitments on future exploitation. 
The consortium is responsible for the various stages of the challenges and should provide the 
necessary support resources during each stage of the competition, including technical 
assistance and business support to develop an exploitation strategy, but most importantly, 
provide the data necessary to fine-tune models and build powerful solutions meeting industry 
needs. 
Proposals should be driven by impactful use-cases where generative AI can make the 
difference: a number of industries from the targeted sector are expected to join forces to 
define challenging problems to solve with GenAI solutions, which then drive the rest of the 
project. Based on such challenges, the consortium organises a multi-staged competition with 
an increasing level of complexity. In the first two stages, third parties, either single companies 
(typically start-ups or SMEs) or small team of organisations built around such start-
ups/SMEs, compete to address the challenges with GenAI solutions. After these stages, the 
solutions retained for the last stage will be invited to join the consortium, as full beneficiaries. 
For each proposal: 
• Stage 1: a challenge, open to all, will allow to select for stage 2 the 20 highest ranked 
solutions, according to a pre-defined selection process and criteria. Each solution 
competing for the challenge can be submitted either by a single start-up/SME, developer 
of GenAI solutions, or a small team of organisations built around such start-up/SME 
• Stage 2: the 20 solutions selected from stage 1 receive EUR 250 000 FSTP funding, in 
form of a grant, in order to address the challenge set for this stage by the consortium. At 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 164 of 339 
the end of stage 2, the 4 highest ranked competing solutions will be selected for the next 
stage according to a pre-defined selection process and criteria. 
• Stage 3: after the end of stage 2 and the corresponding FSTP scheme, the 4 selected 
solutions will be invited to join the consortium and receive EUR 2 millions grants each 
(as part of the eligible costs of the grant agreement) to prepare for the grand finale. The 
consortium should define measures to maximise the impact for the team winning the 
grand finale at the end of the third stage, and maximise the uptake of their solutions (for 
instance, the best performing team could be offered the opportunity to conclude 
partnerships or contracts with the user industries leading the consortium. Measures to 
support the broad uptake of their solutions in the whole sector should also be 
considered).   
Such multi-staged scheme is expected to be implemented in parallel by the successful 
proposals, each addressing a different sector. 
Each proposal, involving several major industry players, should define a clear methodology to 
implement the various steps of the approach, define the specifications of the stages of the 
competitions, timelines, targets, KPIs, a solid evaluation methodology including evaluation 
criteria. The main information should be in the proposal, even if refinements could be further 
developed during the project. The proposers will also be in charge of implementing the 
evaluation methodology, and providing the necessary infrastructure/technical support for the 
participants to the challenges. The consortium members are also responsible for ensuring high 
visibility of the competitions, including possible sponsorships. 
The actions selected from this call, each addressing one of the three targeted sectors, are 
expected to collaborate among themselves, in order to make economies of scale in sharing 
best practices, defining processes for organising the challenges, ensuring efficient monitoring, 
organising dissemination and communication activities, etc. Such collaboration among the 
linked actions is expected to be formalised by a collaboration agreement, after the Grant 
Agreement signature. 
For each proposal, an amount of EUR 5 millions is foreseen to be distributed among the 
winners of stage 1, in form of FSTP grants, in order to prepare for stage 2. In addition, a 
budget of EUR 8 millions is reserved in the initial grant, to carry out the stage 3 of the 
challenge. The proposal is expected to make the case for such investment in defining the 
objectives with sufficient level of information, even if the details are to be further elaborated 
in the course of the project. Such amount will be distributed equally among the 4 winning 
teams of the stage 2, who will be invited to join the consortium as beneficiaries to develop 
further the solutions and compete for the stage 3 of the challenge. 
Visibility would be important; therefore dissemination and communication campaigns are 
key. The proposers are also encouraged to seek sponsorship, which would be key for the 
visibility and prestige of their challenge, and to attract the best developers from the EU and 
associated countries to compete, particularly SMEs and startups, alone or within a team 
competing for the challenges.

All proposals are expected to incorporate mechanisms for assessing and demonstrating 
progress, including qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking, and progress monitoring. 
This should include the methodology to accompany the challenge participants to the various 
stages during the project, and the assessment methodology during the various selection stages. 
As part of the KPIs, efficiency gains from Generative AI should be considered, to maximize 
broader impact. 
When possible, proposals should build on and reuse public results from relevant previous 
funded actions. Communicable results should be shared with the European R&D community 
through the AI-on-demand platform, and if necessary, other relevant digital resource 
platforms to bolster the European AI, Data, and Robotics ecosystem by disseminating results 
and best practices.

• Support to the AI Office in its function to conduct evaluations of general purpose AI 
models with a view to enforce the AI Act' rules for general purpose AI models and 
facilitate self-evaluation for GPAI model developers to ensure compliance with AI Act 
requirements.  
Scope: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has led to the development of 
increasingly sophisticated general-purpose AI (GPAI) models and systems. These models, 
such as large language models and multimodal AI systems, demonstrate remarkable 
capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, assessing the capabilities of these models 
remains a significant challenge. Traditional evaluation methods often fail to capture the full 
spectrum of abilities exhibited by GPAI models and systems. Therefore, there is a pressing 
need for the development of new assessment frameworks, methodologies and tools that can 
comprehensively evaluate these models in terms of their trustworthy and ethical behaviour 
and operation, ensuring their reliability, fairness, and alignment with human values. 
This topic aims to develop robust assessment tools, techniques, and benchmarks specifically 
designed to rigorously evaluate GPAI models and systems, including multimodal systems. 
Proposals should cover one or more of the following research areas: 
• Innovative methods for proactively identifying and forecasting emergent capabilities in 
GPAI models and systems. This encompasses the identification of capabilities with both 
beneficial and potentially detrimental uses. 
• Assessment of GPAI capabilities with a significant economic impact or potential for 
misuse. This includes assessing capabilities that drive beneficial innovation and societal 
good, as well as evaluating potential risks in areas such as chemical, biological, 
radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) hazards or cybersecurity threats. 
• Developing assessment techniques that illuminate the underlying mechanisms of 
emergent capabilities in AI systems, emphasising interpretability and explainability.  
Projects should generate example benchmark tests to examine trained AI models, 
systematically uncovering latent capabilities. These benchmarks will be made available to 
GPAI providers, policymakers, and other relevant stakeholders to implement robust 
evaluation tools. 
This topic strongly encourages the formation of interdisciplinary teams combining the 
necessary technical expertise. Such a collaborative approach will ensure that assessments 
accurately capture real-world use cases, including capabilities elicitation techniques, and that 
the developed frameworks, methodologies and tools are responsive to the concerns of all 
relevant stakeholders. 
This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH 
experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce 
meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research 
activities.

Proposals must adhere to Horizon Europe's requirements regarding Open Science. Open 
access to research outputs should be provided unless there is a legitimate reason or constraint; 
in such cases, the proposal should detail how GPAI providers, policymakers, and other 
stakeholders will access the research outcomes. 
All proposals are expected to incorporate mechanisms for assessing and demonstrating 
progress, including qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking, and progress monitoring. 
This should include participation in international evaluation contests and the presentation of 
illustrative application use-cases that demonstrate concrete potential added value. 
Communicable results should be shared with the European R&D community through the AI-

Expected Outcome: Increased exploitation of novel materials, design methods, and control 
techniques for soft robotics, enabling the creation of inherently safe and versatile robotic 
systems with applications in various industries, including healthcare, maintenance, 
manufacturing, and transportation. 
Scope: Soft robotics160 represents an important avenue to advance robotics, particularly for 
enhancing safety and physical interaction. Its potential lies in creating systems with intrinsic 
and functional safety, capable of securely interacting with humans across various scenarios. 
By using compliant designs, these systems overcome the limitations of rigid robotic systems, 
such as limited adaptability and reduced safety around humans. Novel design methods, the 
use of smart materials, deformable physical architectures, and bioinspired approaches are key 
to improving robotic performance. However, significant challenges remain in learning, 
modelling, simulation, control, actuation, sensing, and the integration of soft electronics. 
To address this, proposals should focus on exploiting novel materials and design methods for 
non-rigid structures, along with advanced control techniques for soft robotic systems. 
Proposals should cover one or more of the following areas: 
• Exploitation of novel materials suited to developing robotic systems, both as the main 
structure and of manipulators and end effectors. These may encompass passive and 
active materials, and combination materials with specific properties. 
• Design methods for non-rigid structures and the means to accurate and sense position 
where this may no longer involve fixed rotational or linear links 
• Control methods for structures built from novel and soft materials or for structures that 
emulate rigid structures using soft materials.  
The proposals should include at least three different demonstrators from different sectors that 
clearly show the advantage of soft robotics in the context of some chosen application 
scenarios. The objective is to develop and disseminate general purpose tools and systems, 
therefore the results should not be limited to the demonstration scenarios selected in the 
proposals to demonstrate the technological progress. 
All proposals are expected to incorporate mechanisms for assessing and demonstrating 
progress, including qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking, and progress monitoring. 
When possible, proposals should build on and reuse public results from relevant previous 
funded actions. Communicable results should be shared with the European R&D community 
through the AI-on-demand platform, and if necessary, other relevant digital resource 
platforms to bolster the European AI, Data, and Robotics ecosystem by disseminating results

Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to some of the following 
expected outcomes: 
• Development of General Purpose AI (GPAI) models and architectures demonstrating 
enhanced capabilities, such as formal reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, 
confidence level estimation, long-term planning, and seamless adaptation to dynamic 
and non-stationary environments. 
• Innovative learning approaches combining self-supervised learning with hybrid learning, 
active learning, reinforcement learning, transfer learning, relational learning or continual 
learning and evolutionary learning. 
• Theoretical insights to advance the understanding of synergies between self-supervised 
and complementary learning paradigms in GPAI model development.  
Scope: Current large-scale AI models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities that have 
transformed numerous fields. They excel at tasks like natural language processing, image 
generation, and playing complex games. However, despite these successes, current models 
often struggle in several key areas. They lack the adaptability to seamlessly adjust to changing 
conditions in real-world environments. Additionally, their reasoning abilities remain limited, 
when facing complex tasks that require logical deduction, mathematical problem-solving, or 
multi-step planning. Moreover, current GPAI models frequently fail to recognise their own 
limitations, leading them to generate erroneous outputs when presented with queries outside 
their domains of knowledge. These limitations underscore the need for advancements in 
General Purpose AI (GPAI) that go beyond pattern recognition and towards robust, adaptive 
systems capable of a wider range of intelligent behaviours, for example, taking inspirations 
from biological and collective systems. 
To push the boundaries of current AI technology, this topic seeks the development of 
groundbreaking GPAI models that combine self-supervised learning with complementary

learning strategies. These strategies include hybrid learning, which integrates symbolic 
reasoning and knowledge representation; active learning, which allows models to actively 
seek information to improve their performance; reinforcement learning, which enables models 
to learn through interaction with their environment; relational learning, which focuses on 
learning from relational data structures; continual learning, which allows models to 
continuously adapt and acquire new knowledge without forgetting previous tasks; and 
evolutionary learning, which draws inspiration from biological evolution to optimize model 
architectures and parameters; and physics-based learning, which considers physical properties 
in the models’ architectures. By leveraging these complementary approaches, the aim is to 
create GPAI models that exhibit enhanced capabilities, overcome existing limitations, and 
pave the way for a new generation of intelligent systems capable of tackling complex, real-
world challenges. 
This topic prioritizes proposals that explore innovative approaches to developing GPAI 
models, focusing on at least one of the following key research areas: 
• Hybrid Learning Architectures for Advanced Reasoning: Development of architectures 
integrating self-supervised learning with symbolic reasoning, knowledge representation, 
and neuro-symbolic methods to foster robust reasoning, complex planning, and problem-
solving abilities within GPAI. 
• Continual and Evolutionary Learning for Dynamic Environments: Research on 
paradigms enabling GPAI models to seamlessly adapt, learn from changing conditions, 
and retain knowledge essential for operation in dynamic, real-world environments. 
• Reinforcement Learning Integration: Research on the fusion of self-supervised learning 
and reinforcement learning to overcome challenges like non-stationary data, algorithm 
sensitivity, and computational cost. 
• Explainable AI and Trustworthy Decision-Making: Integration of robust XAI 
methodologies, exploring causal inference and counterfactual reasoning techniques to 
enhance transparency, accountability, and responsible use of GPAI models in alignment 
with European values and principles. 
• Other Novel Paradigms: Research on the combination of self-supervised learning with 
other learning paradigms, such as active learning, relational learning, and embodied 
learning, to equip GPAI models with new advanced capabilities.  
Proposed projects should aim for a balanced approach between theoretical advancements and 
practical applications, with a strong emphasis on the development of GPAI models that align 
with European values and principles, including the AI Act. 
The potential impact of this research extends beyond scientific advancements, as it has the 
potential to transform key European industries and sectors, including advanced robotics, 
personalized healthcare, mobility, manufacturing, sustainable energy solutions, and the 
scientific sector, and to contribute to the EU climate neutrality objective through energy

efficiency. Successful projects will contribute to the development of GPAI models that 
enhance productivity, improve decision-making, and foster innovation across a wide range of 
domains. 
This topic strongly encourages the formation of interdisciplinary teams combining the 
necessary technical expertise. Such a collaborative approach will ensure that assessments 
accurately capture real-world capabilities and risks, and that the developed tools are 
responsive to the concerns of all relevant stakeholders. 
Proposals must adhere to Horizon Europe's requirements regarding Open Science. Open 
access to research outputs should be provided unless there is a legitimate reason or constraint. 
All proposals are expected to incorporate mechanisms for assessing and demonstrating 
progress, including qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking, and progress monitoring. 
This should include participation in international evaluation contests and the presentation of 
illustrative application use-cases that demonstrate concrete potential added value. 
Communicable results should be shared with the European R&D community through the AI-
on-demand platform, and if necessary, other relevant digital resource platforms to bolster the 
European AI, Data, and Robotics ecosystem by disseminating results and best practices. 
This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, data and robotics 
(ADRA), and all proposals are expected to allocate tasks for cohesion activities with ADRA 
and the CSA HORIZON-CL4-2025-03-HUMAN-18: GenAI4EU central Hub. 
Proposals should also build on or seek collaboration with existing projects and develop 
synergies with other relevant European, national or regional initiatives, funding programmes 
and platforms. Regarding European programmes, proposals are expected to develop synergies 
and complementarities with relevant projects funded under Horizon Europe but also under the 
Digital Europe Programme (DEP).

Part 7 - Page 175 of 339 
Scope: Foundation models in science are an evolving idea in the scientific community and go 
beyond the Generative AI trend163. The purpose of this topic is to tap into their potential, and 
to advance the development of AI technology specifically tailored for the needs of science. 
A foundation model164 can integrate information from various modalities of data. This model 
can then be adapted to a wide range of downstream, more specialized tasks. To build 
downstream applications, the foundation model is fine-tuned with additional training and 
task-specific examples. Therefore, a foundation model is itself incomplete but serves as the 
common basis from which many task-specific models can be built via adaptation. 
In science, such foundation models could be trained on data from a specific scientific field 
and then be fine-tuned for a variety of tasks and used by a wider community in the field. 
Proposals should address one of the following scientific domains: 
• (A) Materials science: the development of new, innovative and advanced materials is 
essential for EU’s economic security and for achieving a competitive and sustainable 
industry (especially sectors such as energy, mobility, construction, health and 
electronics). Employing AI in the process of materials design, characteristics and 
discovery could significantly accelerate and scale potential innovative solutions. 
• (B) Climate change science: advancing climate research is critical for achieving the EU's 
climate neutrality and resilience goals. AI foundation models can contribute to more 
accurate insights into climate dynamics, enhanced predictions of extreme weather 
events, regional impacts and the evolution of climate tipping points. 
• (C) Environmental pollution sciences: advancing environmental sciences can support the 
detection and characterisation of pollution sources, as well as their pathways, 
distribution and impacts to the environment and human health. This is particularly 
relevant in the case of pollutants of concern, emerging and/or less known pollutants. 
• (D) Agricultural sciences: advancing agricultural sciences research is critical to achieve 
a competitive, resilient and sustainable agricultural system. AI foundation models can 
contribute to enhance crop, livestock, soil and water management.  
Proposals should focus on 1) developing foundation models (not limited to Generative AI) for 
science in the chosen domain; 2) showing a foundation model’s usefulness by adapting it to

subtasks/scientific problems in the chosen domain; and 3) illustrating other possible areas of 
application. 
The foundation models should provide researchers with access to essential AI-enabled 
capabilities for scientific discovery; employ the machine learning algorithms, models and 
architectures best suited for the chosen domain; be adaptable to different problems in the 
domain165; and be based on a robust and reliable architecture, as any potential errors and 
problems would be propagated to the downstream applications. 
The foundation models should be placed at the disposal of the scientific community as open 
models, including the source code and, where possible, training datasets and other associated 
assets needed for full reusability of the foundation models (unless justified otherwise). This 
will serve a wider scientific community, thus broadening access to such scientific 
infrastructure and facilitating the use and adaptation of the model to different problems. 
Proposers should provide a clear documentation on the use and limitations of the model, 
alongside case studies demonstrating the model's application to a variety of tasks/problems in 
the chosen domain. 
Multidisciplinary research activities should involve both AI and domain scientists, and 
address some of the following: 
• Conceptualisation and planning: the scope, objectives and expected outcomes of the 
foundation model; 
• Suitable interfaces for domain experts without computer science background to 
contribute to and utilise the outcomes; 
• Data identification, collection and management of (preferably diverse, multimodal) 
datasets through semantically annotation data schemas; 
• Model development, validation, testing under relevant operational and environmental 
conditions (such as thermal gradients, fatigue, corrosion, etc.) and, as appropriate, model 
evaluation and benchmarking, for example DOME166; 
• Integration of domain knowledge into the model (for example through machine readable 
representations like RDF (Resource Description Framework).  
Proposals should: 
• Prove access to high quality (multimodal) data needed for the development of the model. 
If in the process of developing the model, there is a need to create new data sets or adapt 
existing ones, they should follow the FAIR167 principles. Describe the data curation and 
quality control procedures that will be used to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and 
consistency of the training data.

sense of vast amounts of data (for example knowledge graphs). 
• Identify at least four possible use cases and scientific challenges that can be addressed 
with the model and its adaptations.169 
• Identify and assess the potential risks of misuse of the foundation model. 
• Propose a plan to make the model public, maintain and evolve it and promote it to the 
scientific community on a regular basis, in order to give visibility to the concept, discuss 
key findings and anticipate the technology evolution – possibly in synergy with other 
relevant projects.  
Proposals should involve expertise in Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH), in the cases 
where legal and ethical experts should be involved to address data privacy, sharing 
agreements, and compliance with regulations. 
Synergies with the selected projects from HORIZON-INFRA-2025-01-EOSC-06: Using 
Generative AI (GenAI4EU) for Scientific Research via EOSC are encouraged, where 
relevant. Proposals are encouraged to collaborate with established infrastructures such as the 
WeatherGenerator170 project. 
International cooperation is encouraged, where the EU has reciprocal benefit, like the Trillion 
Parameter Consortium.171

options towards optimising the ecosystem for AI in Science in Europe, through a Strategic 
Research & Innovation Agenda and assessing the potential for possible future R&I 
initiative(s), in line with the recommendations of the Scientific Advice Mechanism173, and the 
European Commission President’s political guidelines, for the setting up of an AI Research 
Council174.. 
The project should develop a Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda for AI in 
Science by mobilising large groups of domain and AI researchers in different fields to 
identify key long-term research challenges in a diverse range of scientific areas where AI 
can make a meaningful difference for scientific breakthroughs, which are compelling to 
the EU competitive, environmental and social policy agenda. The project should come up 
with pilot areas from across Horizon Europe Pillar II Clusters, building on Europe’s 
competitive advantages in science and AI technologies. The research challenges should be 
related to prediction and design problems in the different scientific fields identified that could 
be solved with AI. 
The SRIA should also include areas where AI can improve generic scientific tasks e.g virtual 
research assistant / tools for literature-based discovery, for improving / enabling research 
workflows, lab automation and collaborative human-AI work in science. Research priority 
areas involving the use of models based on frugal AI, which are more compact, more efficient 
and less energy intensive, as well as human-centric and trustworthy AI for scientific work 
should also be explored. 
The project should build evidence and assess the needs and potential for R&I initiatives 
for AI in Science beyond the CSA, in an effort to identify ways to improve the EU 
landscape for support for AI in Science, to be discussed and agreed upon with the 
Commission and the Member States. The assessment should identify the ways for 
improving data access, infrastructure and support services, as well as skills and talent-related 
needs to boost the integration of AI in different fields of science at larger scale in Europe in 
research processes and lab automation, while promoting reproducibility, transparency and 
open science. It should also identify options for EU to better enable cooperative development 
and sharing of AI models for scientific discovery across different scientific fields. It should 
also take into account existing EU efforts to support access to data, research infrastructures, 
networks, HPC. 
Different scenarios of R&I initiatives and infrastructure improvements should be prototyped 
together with a diverse range of users and stakeholders from the research community, 
industry, start-ups, civil society and policy-maker communities. Based on the feasibility test 
results, the project should develop a roadmap on the needed steps for a more effective 
coordination between the domain and AI scientific communities in Europe and the needed 
upgrades in service and infrastructure provision at EU level for the integration of AI in

Destination 5: Open Strategic Autonomy in Developing, Deploying and Using Global 
Space-Based Infrastructure, Services, Applications and Data 
Today, EU citizens enjoy watching satellite TV, increasingly accurate global navigation 
services for all transport modes and users, extended Earth monitoring for land, marine, 
atmosphere and climate change, global meteorological observation and accurate cartographies 
of a wide number of variables. Space also makes important contributions to security crisis 
management and emergency services. EU Space Programme components (such as EGNSS 
and Copernicus) are key assets for the EU policies on climate, environment, transport, 
agriculture and secure society. Finally, the Space sector is a source of economic growth and 
jobs. 
This Destination is structured along the following building blocks: 
• Accessing Space, i.e. the ability to transport satellites, cargo, and humans into space; 
build and launch the required vehicles, including re-usable systems; and operate the 
related facilities and services; 
• Using Space on Earth, i.e. the ability to provide space-based secure communication, 
navigation and Earth observation services and applications, including through the EU 
Space flagships Galileo, Copernicus and IRIS2; 
• Monitoring Space, i.e. the ability to detect, track and anticipate the trajectory of 
spacecraft, Near-Earth objects, and space debris during their full lifetime; to share data 
with relevant stakeholders; and to provide solutions for safe international space traffic 
management. It also includes the tracking and anticipation of other impacts on the space 
environment, such as Space weather events; 
• Acting in Space, i.e. the ability to inspect, rendezvous and dock, grasp, repair, 
reconfigure, build, assemble and disassemble, reuse/recycle, relocate, remove and 
transport operational, non-operational, and other objects in space, including platforms or 
larger structures; 
• Exploring Space, i.e. the ability to conduct high profile space exploration activities, 
perform excellent science and exploit space data to increase our knowledge about the 
Universe and celestial bodies, with a view to their exploration for scientific and socio-
economic benefits; 
• Boosting Space, i.e. the ability to sustain the above strategic capabilities through 
fostering the competitiveness of the EU space sector; improving education and 
developing the required skills; accelerating the pace of innovation; supporting EU non-
dependency on critical technologies; and strengthening international cooperation.  
Those building blocks are implemented through the following headings: 
• Heading 1: Accessing Space  

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 182 of 339 
Autonomous access to space is a prerequisite for the strategic autonomy of the EU. It is a key 
enabler and indispensable element in the space ecosystem and value chain. European launch 
systems allow the autonomous deployment of satellites for the Union’s flagships Copernicus, 
Galileo/EGNOS and IRIS2 and contribute to the security and resilience of Europe’s sovereign 
space infrastructure. 
In a context of fierce competition and launch services paradigm changes, ensuring that Europe 
improves the resilience and the cost-effectiveness of its autonomous access to space is crucial. 
This requires urgent activities to enable and further consolidate operational capacities before 
2030. 
This challenge will be tackled by fostering space transportation solutions through the support 
to building blocks for smart technologies and digital solutions and contributing to facilitate 
access to European spaceports. 
In a forward-looking approach and thanks to the implementation of a European Parliament 
Preparatory Action (outside the scope of Horizon Europe), a new R&I approach will be 
applied toward a more service-oriented and less prescriptive support of the full development 
cycle of access to space innovations. At the same time, a reflection will be carried out to 
envisage follow-up actions through the 26-27 WP and future programmes. 
• Heading 2: Acting in Space  
Act in space is a key enabler of the future freedom of action of the EU. In-Space Operations 
and Services (ISOS) will ensure EU’s freedom of action in space and increase the resilience, 
sustainability, safety and protection of its space infrastructure, and contribute to the 
strengthening of the competitiveness of the EU space sector. R&I activities should bring the 
Europe to the forefront of emerging service applications, including inspection, rendezvous 
and docking, grasping, repair, reconfiguration, assembly and disassembly, manufacturing, 
resource extraction, reuse/recycling, removal and transport of objects in space, for satellites, 
platforms and larger structures. Key space R&I activities will be driven by a pilot mission that 
will contribute to establish and foster a new in-space economy. 
Game-changing innovations and enabling technologies are at the heart of ISOS and an 
important focus of future actions. The paradigm shift towards adaptive space systems builds 
on automation and robotics, artificial intelligence, modular and reconfigurable spacecraft 
concepts. Together with other enabling technologies such as electric propulsion, they will 
provide new ways on how space assets are designed, produced, tested, transported, and 
operated. Different means realised with AppStore-like approaches will benefit the future 
space ecosystem and foster a circular economy. 
• Heading 3: Using Space on Earth related to telecommunications  
The Union Secure Connectivity programme aims to develop a secure and autonomous space-
based connectivity system for the provision of guaranteed and resilient satellite 
communications on Earth. Among the objectives are to develop, build and operate a 
multiorbital space-based state-of-the-art connectivity system, continuously adapted to 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 183 of 339 
governmental satellite communications demand evolution; to complement the Union pool of 
satellite communication capacities and services; and to integrate the GOVSATCOM ground 
segment infrastructure, as well as the European quantum communication infrastructure 
(EuroQCI). 
• Heading 4: Using Space on Earth related to Earth Observation  
Copernicus core services (Climate Change, Marine Environment Monitoring, Land 
Monitoring, Atmosphere Monitoring, Emergency Management and Security) should evolve 
and improve to better respond to new and emerging policy needs, and to leverage the latest 
science and technology developments. The Copernicus service evolution research topics will 
focus on further enhancing the services in the areas of coupled Earth system reanalysis and 
exploitation of past and emerging satellite and other data streams, soil-vegetation-atmosphere 
modelling for volatile organic compounds and pollen, wildfire risk forecasting and related 
carbon emissions, and ocean data assimilation and ensemble prediction. The digital 
transformation across services and value chains will be promoted via a dedicated broad topic 
on AI to stimulate innovation and know-how exchange. In connection with the Space Data 
Economy, downstream market uptake research activities will focus on energy, climate 
adaptation and environmental footprint reduction, green financing and insurance, and liveable 
cities of the future. Innovation in Earth observation services will also be supported in the field 
of ship source pollution detection in the context of evolving maritime policies. 
• Heading 5: Using Space on Earth related to satellite navigation  
For Galileo/EGNOS, the international context, the competitive environment with emerging 
actors and novel techniques in the value chain, the increasing threats, and the evolution of the 
technologies, components and systems, including dual-use technology, call for a constant 
adaptation of the EU space infrastructure to these changing realities. 
To meet these challenges, EU needs sustained investments in R&D for innovative mission 
concepts, technology and systems. These will ensure the continuity of the EGNSS service, 
minimise the risks for technology inclusion in the infrastructure, thanks to anticipated 
development and testing including in-orbit, protect better this infrastructure against modern 
threats (notably cyber, jamming/spoofing, natural hazards), and increase the strategic 
autonomy in key technologies. Overall, they will maintain the EU´s leadership position in the 
Global Navigation Satellite Systems. 
• Heading 6: Using Space on Earth related to services and data coming from 
satellites  
Over 10% of the European GDP is enabled by economical activities linked to the need of 
location through satellite navigation systems. Whilst the market uptake of EGNSS is already 
good in many areas, important priorities still remain, in particular 1) support the development 
of solutions that underpin EU priorities and policies, including the Green Deal, 2) support the 
public sector as a customer of Galileo, 3) foster the competitiveness of EU downstream 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 184 of 339 
industry and SMEs/start-ups and 4) leverage synergies with other space programmes and non-
space technologies. 
Downstream R&I activities for EGNSS applications are needed to support the uptake of the 
new services/differentiators (i.e. Galileo High Accuracy Service and Open Service Navigation 
Message Authentication, made available in 2022 for testing and initial services, Galileo 
Emergency Warning Service to be made available in 2025 and Galileo Public Regulated 
Services to be made available soon). Opportunities to be market leader lie a.o. in autonomous 
driving, unmanned vehicles (aerial, terrestrial and maritime), location-based services, critical 
infrastructures, emergency management and humanitarian aid, insurance and finance, urban 
development and cultural heritage. 
Regarding Copernicus applications, the digital dimension must be reinforced, encouraging the 
collaboration of ICT players with Earth observation and space stakeholders. The uptake of 
applications using Copernicus data could be improved, including by public authorities, who 
are important potential customers. Also, while many applications are developed for the land 
sector, other areas are less active. Solutions for a more sustainable use of resources and 
preserving biodiversity should be reinforced, as well as for countering natural hazards and 
climate extreme events as well as climate change mitigation and adaptation. 
• Heading 7: Monitoring Space  
Orbital space infrastructure, the data, and the services they deliver have become indispensable 
for European societies and economies and in the daily lives of Europeans. However, due to an 
increasingly congested orbital space, the likelihood of a satellite being severely damaged or 
destroyed in a collision has raised dramatically. Such risk calls for action to preserve 
European interests by protecting its private and public investments in space in a sustainable 
manner. 
Based on the EU Space Programme, capabilities of the Space Situational Awareness (SSA) 
component and Space Surveillance and Tracking (SST) services are being developed and 
consolidated through a Partnership of 15 Member States. The EU SST Partnership Agreement 
has officially entered into force on 11 November 2022. With this Partnership, EU SST builds 
on the good results achieved by the initial consortium of 5 Member States (Decision 
541/2014) and targets continuity of activities and service provision, improvement of 
specialisation on expertise, and consideration of the duality and security dimension of SST. 
Partnership’s Member States have joined forces and networked their national assets and 
competences with the objective to establish and improve the Union’s SST capacities to ensure 
the delivery of SST services to European institutions, public authorities, and public and 
private spacecraft operators and owners. Services are structured around three axes: Collision 
Avoidance, Fragmentation Analysis and Re-entry Analysis. EU SST service provision is the 
key operational capability for the EU’s future approach to Space Traffic Management (STM) 
which encompasses the means and the rules to access, conduct activities in, and return from 
outer space safely, sustainably, and securely. 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 185 of 339 
EU SST relies on the European industry, including start-ups, to develop and improve national, 
public-owned capacities based on Partnership’s requirements. As a result, more than 80% of 
the funds delegated by the EU to the EU SST Partnership are sub-contracted to EU industry 
through call for tenders. This has triggered the spawning of a European industrial sector on 
SST activities that should contribute to the EU STM approach. On 15 February 2022, a Joint 
Communication on STM (JOIN/2022/4 final) has been adopted, calling for the enhancement 
of EU operational capabilities to support SST and STM activities (action 2). Within the 
framework of this STM Joint Communication, a European Industry Start-ups Forum on Space 
Traffic Management (EISF) has been created. The Forum aims at directly involving EU 
companies and other relevant stakeholders in the conception of future research and innovation 
activities in the SST/STM domain. 
Further resilience and autonomy of the Union’s SST capabilities will come by leveraging 
complementary contributions from European private capabilities and commercial initiatives. 
At the same time, EU industry is expected to adapt and benefit from new SST market 
opportunities appearing in a rapidly changing environment in and beyond Europe. To that 
end, research and development activities are oriented towards the strengthening of the 
competitiveness of the Union space industry, including start-ups, by increasing its capacity in 
designing, building, and operating its own SST systems. 
Importantly, SSA also covers the domains of Space Weather (SW) and Near-Earth Objects 
(NEO). For those domains, activities are ongoing and no additional ones are needed under the 
2025 WP. 
• Heading 8: Boosting space through non-dependence of the EU for key critical space 
technologies  
Ensuring non-dependence for critical space technologies is key, especially in the current geo-
political context. The European Commission has undertaken several activities and deployed 
new tools (e.g. the EU Observatory of Critical Technologies) for assessing space technologies 
and identify those that are critical from a dependency point of view. Within this domain, a 
number of technological developments will be initiated with focus on priorities stemming 
from on-going and planned EU Space missions, including IRIS2. Emphasis will be on 
reducing non-EU dependencies on critical space technologies across their whole supply chain 
from advanced materials to components, equipment, and sub-systems; providing unrestricted 
access to advanced space technologies relevant for EU space missions and programme 
components; developing or regaining capacity to operate independently in space by 
developing resilient space technologies supply chains, relying on EU supply chains and/or 
trustable and reliable supply chains not affected by non-EU export restrictions; enhancing 
competitiveness by developing products and capabilities reaching equivalent or superior 
performance level than those from outside the EU and compete at worldwide level; and 
opening new opportunities for manufacturers by reducing dependency on export restricted 
technologies. 
• Heading 9: Boosting Space through international cooperation  

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 186 of 339 
International cooperation remains an important enabler as global challenges can best be 
addressed by global solutions. Opportunities lie especially in innovative technologies, in the 
exploitation of space-based data and in downstream applications. 
• Heading 10: Boosting Space through training and education activities  
Preparing the skilled workforce of tomorrow is essential to bridge the gap between supply and 
demand for talents in the European Space sector and inspire the next generation of space 
professionals. 
• Heading 11: Boosting Space through IOD/IOV opportunities  
IOD/IOV opportunities continue to be needed for experiments needing aggregation as well as 
for read-to-fly satellites. This includes the Flight Ticket Initiative to support competitiveness 
and innovation of the European Space sector. 
• Heading 12: Boosting Space through support to entrepreneurship  
Business development, acceleration and upscaling of start-ups is also much needed, which has 
given rise to the set-up of the CASSINI Space Entrepreneurship Initiative. CASSINI provides 
support to business and innovation-friendly ecosystems, including the strengthening business 
skills in the space market segments and digital services based on space data. CASSINI also 
aims at making start-ups and scale-ups investment-ready and able to secure venture capital 
funding and at leveraging synergies with the InvestEU programme and the EU Space 
Programme. 
Limiting participation in certain actions to Member States (and certain associated 
countries to Horizon Europe) 
The Space research part of the Horizon Europe Programme is by default open to the world, 
promoting international cooperation to drive scientific excellence. 
However, an important aspect of this Destination consists in ensuring security and 
strengthening strategic autonomy across key technologies and value chains, taking advantage 
of the possibilities that space offers for the security of the Union and its Member States. This 
objective requires special rules in specific cases to set the requisite eligibility and participation 
conditions to ensure the protection of the integrity, security and resilience of the Union and its 
Member States. Hence, on an exceptional basis and duly justified, this work programme may 
foresee a limited participation to entities from selected countries. Such exceptional 
circumstances would relate to prevalent considerations to safeguard the Union’s strategic 
assets, interests, autonomy or security. Possibilities for such limitations are framed by Article 
22(5) of the Horizon Europe Regulation.

Expected Outcome: The strategic objective of this topic is to develop capabilities to ‘Act in 
Space’ through demonstrating in space a pilot mission by 2030 related to ISOS. The 
envisaged ISOS pilot mission shall provide the necessary seed components for a future 
service infrastructure, available to the European in-space ecosystem (including the EU assets), 
driving the generation of a new in-space economy, providing enhanced in-orbit technology 
demonstration and maximising EU technology non-dependence. 
This pilot mission will largely contribute to ensure EU’s freedom of action in space, increase 
the resilience and protection of EU assets in space and foster the development of the new in-
space economy. A pioneering and a novel mission concept which is unique compared to other 
initiatives among all space-faring nations is envisaged. The mission will build on previous 
R&I with an operational mission concept, focusing on application and service demonstration, 
with a concrete view to commercial and governmental usage. The detailed mission concept 
will be derived in close coordination with EU Member States and EEA countries through a 
dedicated ISOS Pilot Mission Advisory Group (PMAG)188.

This topic addresses the finalisation of the detailed design of the servicing component of the 
ISOS pilot mission, that should feature robotic capabilities. The servicing component will be 
based on previous and ongoing R&I developments and could provide services such as 
inspection, upgrade, repair, life extension including refuelling, delivery and exchange of 
payload, reconfiguration, relocation, capture and removal of assets in space. 
Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes: 
• A sustainable, highly automated and digitalised, flexible and economically viable space 
infrastructure, building on technologies and concepts for a circular economy in space, 
e.g. plug-and-play spacecraft functionality introducing recycling/re-use of spacecraft 
modules/functionalities; 
• ISOS Pilot mission preparation up to detailed mission and system design for the 
servicing component and maturation of enabling technologies and innovative system and 
operational concepts; 
• Elaboration of interfaces between the different components of the mission, together with 
the other mission components (i.e. HOST, logistics and satAPPs) and the ISOS Pilot 
Mission Coordination and Support Action (CSA)189; 
• Contribution to the ISOS Pilot Mission Objectives provided in the technical annex163; 
• Elaboration of clear use cases and relevant business models focussing on governmental 
and/or commercial needs; 
• Ensuring the availability of results to the next mission phases.   
This topic will contribute to, in the medium to long term, developing, deploying global space-
based services and contribute to fostering the European space sector competitiveness, as 
stated in the expected impact of this destination. 
Scope: To tackle the above expected outcomes, the following R&I actions should be 
addressed, taking into account the provided technical annex190: 
• R&I to complete detailed mission and system design 191  (including relevant key 
technology maturation) for the servicing component as part of the ISOS pilot mission. 
More specifically, projects should finalise the detailed design for this component 
building on current or previous developments, demonstrating the achievement of the 
required TRL for all relevant technologies; 
 
replaced by a dedicated expert group that will take over all functions of the PMAG; in this event all 
references to the PMAG will refer to that expert group.

• Contribution to the overall ISOS pilot mission detail design in close cooperation with the 
other mission components (including other servicing components), the ISOS Pilot 
Mission Coordination and Support Action and the ISOS Pilot Mission Advisory Group; 
• R&I on related service capabilities and applications including operational concepts for 
servicing individual or fleets of satellites based on the functionality of the pilot mission 
system design. More specifically, possible use case for servicing a real EU asset is 
expected to be developed up to delivery of a concept of operations (CONOPS).   
Projects are expected to ensure full compliance to the ISOS detailed pilot mission concept 
including interoperability with the other mission components, in case a possibility for a 
standalone IOD for the proposed servicing component materialises earlier than the ISOS pilot 
mission. 
Proposals are expected to promote cooperation between different actors (industry, SMEs and 
research institutions) and consider opportunities to quickly turn technological innovation into 
commercial use in space via e.g., on-ground or in-orbit demonstration. 
Proposals should clearly present a concrete plan to ensure that required technologies reach the 
necessary TRL at the end of the project. Moreover, complementarities with previous and/or 
ongoing R&I for the proposed servicing component should be clearly described. More 
specifically, proposals should explore relevant and promising solutions developed in Horizon 
Europe, Horizon 2020, or other EU-funded relevant activities, in particular, the topics: Future 
Space Ecosystem (HORIZON-CL4-2021-SPACE-01-12/ 2022-SPACE-01-11/ 2023-SPACE-
01-12) and in relevant projects funded by the European Space Agency (ESA) and/or national 
programmes. Finally, proposals are also expected to consider the use of existing European 
technologies and/or building blocks, including at component level, contributing to European 
non-dependence and strengthen competitiveness.  
Proposals are expected to consider and contribute to a balanced provision of Member States’ 
and eligible Associated Countries’ expertise and capabilities to the overall ISOS pilot mission, 
to support a successful introduction of the strategic capacity ‘Act in Space’ for the EU, its 
Member States and other partners.

Expected Outcome: The strategic objective of this topic is to develop capabilities to ‘Act in 
Space’ through demonstrating in space a pilot mission by 2030 related to ISOS. The 
envisaged ISOS pilot mission shall provide the necessary seed components for a future 
service infrastructure, available to the European in-space ecosystem (including the EU assets), 
driving the generation of a new in-space economy, providing enhanced in-orbit technology 
demonstration and maximising EU technology non-dependence. 
This pilot mission will largely contribute to ensure EU’s freedom of action in space, increase 
the resilience and protection of EU assets in space and foster the development of the new in-
space economy. A pioneering and a novel mission concept, which is unique compared to 
other initiatives among all space-faring nations is envisaged. The mission will build on 
previous R&I with an operational mission concept, focusing on application and service 
demonstration, with a concrete view to commercial and governmental usage. The detailed 
mission concept will be derived in close coordination with EU Member States and EEA 
countries through a dedicated ISOS Pilot Mission Advisory Group (PMAG)161. 
This topic addresses the detailed design of the satAPPs component of the ISOS pilot 
mission, that allows the creation of composable and exchangeable functional modules for 
satellite upgrade and the development of a European catalogue of satAPPs, following the 
AppStore approach and fostering system modularisation and flexibility. 
Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes: 
• A sustainable, highly automated, flexible and economically viable space infrastructure, 
building on technologies and concepts for a circular economy in space, e.g. plug-and-
play 
spacecraft 
functionality 
introducing 
recycling/re-use 
of 
spacecraft 
modules/functionalities; 
• ISOS Pilot mission preparation up to detailed mission and system design for the satAPPs 
component, and maturation of enabling technologies and innovative system and 
operational concepts; 
• Elaboration of interfaces between the different components of the mission, together with 
the other mission components (i.e. servicing, HOST and logistics) and the ISOS Pilot 
Mission Coordination and Support Action (CSA)162; 
• Enhancing opportunities for IOD/V through satAPPs by actively promoting experiment 
plug and play on the HOST and prepared assets; 
• Contribution to the ISOS Pilot Mission Objectives provided in the technical annex163;

• Elaboration of clear use cases and relevant business models focussing on governmental 
and/or commercial needs; 
• Contributing to a European catalogue of satAPPs, following the AppStore approach and 
fostering system modularisation and flexibility; 
• Ensuring the availability of results to the next mission phases.  
This topic will contribute to, in the medium to long term, developing, deploying global space-
based services and contribute to fostering the European space sector competitiveness, as 
stated in the expected impact of this destination. 
Scope: To tackle the above expected outcomes, the following R&I actions should be 
addressed, taking into account the provided technical annex163: 
• R&I to complete ISOS Pilot mission detailed mission and system design164 (including 
relevant key technology maturation) for the satAPPs component. All relevant 
technologies shall reach the necessary TRL. 
• R&I on technologies relevant for innovative satAPPs at TRL 6 that will be used in the 
context of the ISOS pilot mission to demonstrate upgrade of components’ functionalities 
and/or payload exchange and IOD/V experiments. 
• R&I on satAPP modules specifically for hosting IOD/V experiments. 
• Contribution to the overall ISOS pilot mission detail design in close cooperation with 
other mission components, the ISOS Pilot Mission Coordination and Support Action and 
the ISOS Pilot Mission Advisory Group.   
Proposals are expected to promote cooperation between different actors (industry, SMEs and 
research institutions) and consider opportunities to quickly turn technological innovation into 
commercial use in space via e.g., on-ground or in-orbit demonstration. 
Proposals should clearly present a concrete plan to ensure that required technologies reach the 
necessary TRL at the end of the project. Moreover, complementarities with previous and/or 
ongoing R&I for the proposed servicing component must be clearly described. More 
specifically, proposals should explore relevant and promising solutions developed in Horizon 
Europe, Horizon 2020, or other EU-funded relevant activities, in particular, the topics: Future 
Space Ecosystem (HORIZON-CL4-2021-SPACE-01-12/ 2022-SPACE-01-11/ 2023-SPACE-
01-12), EIC Accelerator WP2025 “Innovative in-space servicing, operations, robotics and 
technologies for resilient EU space infrastructure” and in relevant projects funded by the 
European Space Agency (ESA) and/or national programmes. Finally, proposals are also 
expected to consider the use of existing European technologies and/or building blocks, 
including at component level, contributing to European non-dependence and strengthen 
competitiveness. 
International cooperation is encouraged in this topic.

Expected Outcome: The topic encompasses actions within the scope of the co-programmed 
European Partnership on Globally Competitive Space Systems (‘Space Partnership’) in the 
areas of satellite communication (SatCom), Earth Observation (EO) and New Commercial 
Space Transportation Solutions and is part of cohesive activities in the domain of digital 
developments under the grand heading of “digitalisation for commercial space solutions”. 
Under the area of Using Space on Earth related to SatCom and EO, below this topic focus on 
the fast increment of the Low to Mid TRL level building blocks for key technologies required 
to strengthen competitiveness in these domains. Digitalisation is a major enabler for 
enhancing the value of an End-to-End EO and SatCom system. For example, processing 
applied to multi-sensor data can significantly enhance the resolution of the final data set, and 
digital optimisation of the data flow directly improves the End-to-End timeliness of an EO 
system (from request to delivery). Lastly, the enhancement of End-to-End data resilience and 
integrity calls for digital technologies on-board and, on the ground. 
Project results are expected to contribute to one or several of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Enable the European Space Industry to maintain a significant share of the global 
connectivity market by increasing the performance of space satellite networks, new type

Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Innovative methods to prepare and pre-process observational input for Earth-system 
reanalysis datasets, including the Copernicus Sentinel missions, which will lead to an 
increase in the use of observations for Earth-system reanalysis;  
• Enhanced sparse data assimilation and initialisation methods of climate sub-component 
(e.g., atmosphere, ocean, land, hydrology) in Copernicus products;  
• Comprehensive and better information about the climate records to be extracted from the 
available observations improving our overall monitoring of the climate and climate 
change;  
• Expanded range of reanalyses products towards centennial reanalyses, and enhanced 
climate counterfactuals data sets to support data-driven predictions and the ongoing 
operationalisation of extreme event attribution.   
Scope: The areas of R&I to address the above expected outcomes include: 
• Improve the ability of Copernicus’ and other models to assimilate new and other satellite 
observations (e.g. the Copernicus Sentinel Expansion and Next Generation missions, 
contributing missions, meteorological satellites, research satellites) that are sensitive to 
surface parameters and fluxes. It is also necessary to undertake research on information 
content of early satellite data and unlock their exploitation in reanalyses at global and 
regional scales; 
• Exploit innovative methods (including AI/ML) for data rescue for in situ and remote 
sensing observations, in particular regarding past and changing observing methods and 
environmental factors, and on error analysis, quality control and bias adjustment of the 
historical observation record. The aim is to make best possible use of early observations 
from various records of in situ and remote sensing observations to improve physically 
consistent analyses of the atmosphere, the ocean, the land and the cryosphere towards 
centennial timescales;

• Improve the use of Sentinel and other data in all Copernicus reanalyses and their use 
across different services. Beyond processing and reprocessing activities, specific 
coordinated developments in terms of observation operators and observational error 
characterization will be required; 
• Explore innovative methods (e.g. AI/ML) to accelerate the production and updates of 
reanalyses, to capture reanalyses uncertainties efficiently, and to reduce overall 
computing energy/carbon footprint.  
The C3S reanalyses represent a significant portion of the service data requests and are at the 
heart of the service product line and further exploitation (e.g. initialising climate predictions, 
evaluation of climate historical projections, climate intelligence, development of climate 
applications, AI/ML weather forecasts). The preparation of the future C3S coupled Earth 
system reanalyses is underway to significantly improve the consistency across earth system 
components and lengthen the timespan. An extension of the reanalyses back to the early 1900’ 
would meet many requirements of users but such a task would be impossible without an 
adequate investment in data rescue and in the reprocessing of EO data. Reanalyses play a key 
and vital role in climate monitoring and in the attribution of extreme events, but the 
development of the required counterfactual dataset is often ad-hoc and lacks operational 
implementation. 
Bringing together European expertise on a wide variety of observations, climate data records 
and global and regional reanalyses will be paramount, and this will require a very tight 
collaboration with space agencies, the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services, 
and the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO). International cooperation is hence 
strongly encouraged in this topic. This will fully realise the progressive exploitation of 
Copernicus Sentinel and other data for the monitoring of a changing climate over Europe and 
worldwide. In addition, the proposal should include some demonstrations of downstream 
applications that would benefit from these improvements. Synergies with Destination Earth 
are also encouraged. 
Additionally, the transfer of research results to operations should receive active attention 
during the project to strengthen the readiness for an operational deployment in the future. 
Appropriate involvement and/or interaction with the relevant Entrusted Entities of the 
Copernicus services, the conditions for making available, for re-using and exploiting the 
results (including IPR) by the said entities should be addressed during the project 
implementation. Software should be open licensed. 
In this topic, the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and 
innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the 
research effort.

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 221 of 339 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Accurate simulation of the biogenic fluxes of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and 
other atmospheric constituents to represent the corresponding processes in numerical 
models;  
• Enhanced monitoring of environmental policies regarding eutrophication and 
acidification of soils and ecosystems as well as for regulatory reporting commitments; 
• Improved management of soils and vegetation with view to reduce health impacts from 
pollen and VOCs.  
Scope: The areas of R&I to address the above expected outcomes include: 
• Advancing 
soil-vegetation-atmosphere 
surface/interface 
and 
evapo-transpiration 
parameterizations, numerical models and data assimilation techniques; 
• Further development of surface (sub-)models that can account accurately and 
dynamically for the sources and sinks of key trace gases and aerosols and are compatible 
with operational implementation in CAMS global and regional systems; 
• Improvement of methodologies to estimate deposition fluxes and associated 
uncertainties; 
• Develop data assimilation approaches to deliver highly resolved deposition products, 
based on in-situ deposition networks and Earth Observation; 
• Development of accurate pollen source models for additional species among the most 
allergenic ones in Europe (the current pollens in the CAMS portfolio are alder, birch, 
olive, grass, mugwort, and ragweed); 
• Investigation of modelling of pollen at the global scale; 
• Development of further use of satellite observations for improving calculation of dry 
deposition fluxes and emissions.  
Eutrophication and acidifications of ecosystems remain among the most sensitive 
environmental issues which drive the revision of emission reduction strategies (UNECE 
Gothenburg Protocol, NEC Directive). Pollen and many atmospheric trace components such 
as VOCs represent major public health issues, affecting hundreds of millions of people 
globally and in Europe. Elaborated soil-vegetation-atmosphere surface/interface models and 
associated parameterization are needed to represent emissions, concentrations and deposition 
of such constituents. Enhanced numerical models, data assimilation and parameterization 
techniques are needed to characterize the fate of such constituents.

The proposal is expected to develop activities that will improve and expand the operational 
global and regional atmospheric composition analyses, forecasts, and reanalyses. In addition, 
the proposal should include some demonstrations of downstream applications that would 
benefit from these improvements. Synergies with Destination Earth are encouraged. 
The main output of the project should be tools and methodologies that can be readily 
transferred to the CAMS operational global and regional systems. Coordination with CLMS is 
also encouraged. 
The transfer of research results to operations should receive active attention during the project 
to strengthen the readiness for an operational deployment in the future. Appropriate 
involvement and/or interaction with the relevant Entrusted Entities of the Copernicus services, 
the conditions for making available, for re-using and exploiting the results (including IPR) by 
the said entities must be addressed during the project implementation. Particular attention 
should be paid to the potential use and complementarities with the products already developed 
in the other Copernicus services. Strengthening Copernicus services collaboration could be 
foreseen. Software should be open licensed. 
Proposals are encouraged to build on or collaborate with related EU funded projects like 
SYLVA (biogenic aerosol) or CERTAINTY and CleanCloud on modelling. 
In this topic, the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and

Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Enable accounting for the interaction between droughts, fires and vegetation in the

• Improve the fire risk forecasting in the Copernicus Emergency Management Service 
(CEMS); 
• Improve the assimilation of Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) products in 
vegetation fire impact and carbon fluxes assessments.   
Scope: The areas of R&I to address the above expected outcomes include: 
• Better understand and characterise the impact of wildfires on the carbon cycle and on 
anthropogenic emissions through land use change. This has been recognized especially 
in the climate community when developing process-based vegetation models for use in 
climate models. While a large variety of empirical or process-based vegetation models

exist today, it is still unclear which type of model or degree of complexity is required to 
model fire adequately at regional to global scales. International collaborations, such as 
the Fire Model Intercomparison Project (FireMIP), have evaluated existing global fire 
models against benchmark data sets for present-day and historical conditions; 
• Investigate the current state of fire modelling and specifically how the interaction 
between droughts, fires and vegetation can be accounted for in a global monitoring 
system, such as the CO2MVS. Because of the monitoring aspects of the CO2MVS, use 
should be made, where possible, of including observation-based data sets representing 
certain aspects of the fire-vegetation interaction; 
• Investigate how a better understanding of the impact of fires on vegetation can improve 
the estimates of fire emissions of chemical species and aerosols, and subsequently air 
quality products in CAMS and the fire risk forecasting in CEMS.  
Wildfires have become widespread during summer over many regions of the world, including 
Europe, and have major safety and larger societal impacts (air quality and health, aviation, 
weather, agriculture, etc). Wildfires and biomass burning are significant sources of CO2 and 
air pollutants in the atmosphere. Fires also change the vegetation and therefore affect the 
exchange of CO2 between the biosphere and the atmosphere. Current vegetation and fire 
models need to be improved to refine the quality of CAMS products (air quality, emissions), 
the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) supporting CEMS and forcing data sets for 
climate projections supporting the IPCC. Innovative methodologies should be investigated to 
include fire-vegetation interactions, also taking into account the impact of drought conditions 
in global monitoring systems such as the CO2MVS capacity, via the improvement of 
currently used process-based vegetation models or through empirical models. The use of 
relevant observation-based data sets (e.g. vegetation states, drought conditions, burnt areas) 
should be a key element of these methodologies. Current CLMS products should be 
considered, including options for potential improved specifications. The proposal should 
include some demonstrations of downstream applications that would benefit from these 
improvements. 
The transfer of research results to operations should receive active attention during the project 
to strengthen the readiness for an operational deployment in the future. Appropriate 
involvement and/or interaction with, and/or coordination across the relevant Entrusted Entities 
of the Copernicus services, the conditions for making available, for re-using and exploiting 
the results (including IPR) by the said entities must be addressed during the project 
implementation. Software should be open licensed. 
The possible participation of the JRC may consist in (1) ensuring access to relevant models, 
tools and datasets of the operational CEMS, (2) providing a good understanding of existing 
operational workflows for CEMS and advice regarding the operational feasibility of new 
developments and (3) testing of new developments/prototypes for CEMS in a pre-operational 
setting.

analysis and forecasting systems;  
• To strengthen data assimilation development exchanges between operational centres and 
to facilitate scientific community contributions.   
Scope: The areas of R&I to address the above expected outcomes include: 
• Coupled data assimilation (e.g. between ocean and biogeochemistry, ocean and sea-ice, 
ocean and waves and atmosphere) to control in a more consistent way the ocean state 
variables across ocean components or forcings and to get more benefits from 
observations; 
• Development of multi-scale methods capable of assimilating high-resolution and high-
frequency observations as well as of constraining larger scales; 
• Development of methods to produce reliable estimation of analysis and forecast 
uncertainties; 
• Use of Artificial Intelligence techniques in data assimilation schemes (e.g. use of 
emulators for ensemble generation, model error estimation, bias correction, separation of 
scale and model parameter estimation); 
• Use of new types of observations (e.g. new Sentinel Expansion and Next Generation 
missions, new in-situ observations) or higher-resolution of existing data streams; 
• Development of methods and tools to systematically assess the observing system impact 
in data assimilation systems (e.g. analysis and forecast sensitivity to observation); 
• The development of software infrastructure that can accommodate different assimilation 
methods (including artificial intelligence techniques), and facilitate the sharing of 
algorithms and optimization of computer codes (assimilation schemes) on high-
performance computers;

• The development of validation and intercomparison protocols to estimate and quantify 
the benefits of improved assimilation methods and integration of new observations (e.g. 
data challenges, use of OSSEs).  
The development of new types of observations from satellites and in-situ and the 
improvement of space/time sampling of existing observations require a step change in data 
assimilation techniques to fully benefit from these new sources of data. Current techniques are 
facing hard limits to progress and need new approaches to make the best use of observation 
and advances in modelling (e.g. resolution). Emerging coupling, multi-scale, ensemble and 
artificial intelligence techniques represent new opportunities for significant improvements in 
ocean data assimilation. The proposal should include some demonstrations of downstream 
applications that would benefit from these improvements. 
The transfer of research results to operations should receive active attention during the project 
to strengthen the readiness for an operational deployment in the future. Appropriate 
involvement and/or interaction with the relevant Entrusted Entities of the Copernicus services, 
the conditions for making available, for re-using and exploiting the results (including IPR) by

should remain an important player in these initiatives. International cooperation is hence 
encouraged in this topic.

• Transformed user experience through enhanced interactivity and on-demand capabilities 
for Copernicus services; 
• Exchange of knowledge, benchmarking and best practices on using AI/ML in the context 
of Copernicus; 
• Enhanced AI-readiness of Copernicus data, in particular open and free high-value 
labelled Copernicus data sets.   
Scope: The areas of R&I to address the above expected outcomes include: 
• AI-supported retrieval algorithms on both passive and active sensing for existing and 
upcoming Copernicus missions; 
• Fast, reliable, consistent, and as much as possible sensor agnostic identification of clouds 
and shadows in optical sensing; 
• Multi-source multi-target AI models for automatic segmentation; 
• Physics parameterization and parameter optimization to emulate poorly understood 
processes and increase the fidelity of numerical models; 
• Fault and outlier detection in production and delivery workflows to ensure more robust 
services; 
• Support to automated pre-processing and QA/QC of observations and data to reduce the 
risk of man-made errors and product deficiencies; 
• Data fusion techniques towards added-value products; 
• Data compression and mining methods to navigate big data efficiently, as the amount of 
data is becoming a limiting factor; 
• Hybrid observation operator, ensemble data assimilation techniques, error calibration 
and uncertainty quantification towards improved (re-)analysis and forecast skill; 
• Analysis-driven Earth system deep learning models to boost prediction skill and 
timeliness, including with Digital Twin Earth models. These methods have shown great 
promises when applied to reanalyses for example; 
• Experimenting observation(-only)-driven forecasting to support time-critical service 
elements, circumventing analysis steps. These approaches could be particularly suited 
for observation-dense areas from which processes can be inferred from observations 
alone; 
• Exploring the potential of large pre-trained foundation models and transfer learning at 
scale for Earth system modelling, including with publicly available training datasets 
from Copernicus;

• Downscaling and super resolution applications building on Copernicus data to refine 
products in space and time; 
• Adaptive workflow optimizations; 
• Enhanced interactive interfaces enabling on-demand product and service generation; 
• Chatbots that can guide the user across a wide range of information sources within and 
across Copernicus services for enhanced user support and experience.  
Proposals are expected to address as many of the above areas as possible. 
During the last decade, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, big data volumes and 
computing capacities have developed at an unprecedented pace, and it is now evident that 
Copernicus needs to become even more proactive on the digital transition. AI and machine 
learning offer great opportunities across the Copernicus value chain and workflows to deeply 
transform its data, products, applications, services and user experience. 
However, the scope and speed of developments also generate challenges, in particular 
regarding the necessary know-how that needs to be established, the software and hardware 
infrastructure that need to be developed, and the integration of machine learning and 
conventional tools within production workflows. These challenges need to be addressed 
within a comparably short period of time to keep up with evolving user requirements and to 
leverage emerging AI/ML developments. The project is expected to foster game changer and 
disruptive approaches in particular towards next generation Earth system (re-)analysis and 
prediction systems as well as foundation models, to promote integrated AI/ML strategies and 
intensive cooperation and knowledge transfer with and across Entrusted Entities to pave the 
way into the future of Copernicus. Given the QA/QC requirements on Copernicus products, 
explainable, trustworthy, open-source and responsible use of AI approaches are of particular 
interest, as AI mainly operates as a black box. In the context of recent EU policies, a robust 
framework is required to ensure the same stringent quality, reliability, and verifiability 
requirements of AI-generated products, as well as transparency and clearly labelled 
information to users. Benchmarking approaches to quantify the positive impact and 
improvements of AI/ML methods over time are particularly encouraged. 
Collaboration with the EuroGEO initiative and the project(s) funded from the topic 
HORIZON-CL6-2025-03-GOVERNANCE-09: Delivering Earth Intelligence to accelerate the

The transfer of research results to operations should receive active attention during the project

 Elements of detection of other pollution emissions (MARPOL Annex VI) might 
prove useful and would be considered a plus;    
• Design and improvement of use artificial intelligence methods for the identification of 
spills, sewage and garbage on the sea surface and their characteristics to achieve a higher 
level of timeliness, automation and confidence (e.g. avoid false alerts).   
Context: 
The MARPOL convention adopted at the IMO level regulates the release at sea of substances 
originating from ships, be it from the ship’s operation or cargo operations. The Ship Source 
Pollution Directive adopted in 2005 seeks to strengthen the enforcement in the EU of the 
prohibition of release at sea of substances under Annex I and II of the MARPOL convention. 
Currently, high-resolution satellite imagery of the ocean surface is used to monitor and detect 
potential spill, notably through the CleanSeaNet service, offered by the European Maritime 
Safety Agency. 
The revision of the Directive will expand its scope to discharges in the water under all 
MARPOL annexes. Further research is needed to adapt the current monitoring systems to the 
accurate detection of the substances included under the revised scope of the SSPD as the 
technologies may not be available or accurate enough. 
The objective of this topic is to support R&I activities developing advanced technological 
solutions, that will allow to enhance the service provided to Member States for the detection 
of potential spills and identification of potential polluters. 
R&I activities should complement what is currently being done by EMSA, along 
CleanSeaNet and the Copernicus maritime surveillance service. Moreover, the Copernicus 
Security Services Strategic Research Agenda (CSS-SRA) provides, on a yearly basis, an 
overview of R&D activities, as well as proposed actions based on latest developments. 
Applicants are invited to consult the corresponding additional requirements and information 
based on the CSS-SRA208 and subsequent updates when they become available to develop 
their proposal. 
The transfer of research results to operations should receive active attention during the project 
to strengthen the readiness for an operational deployment in the future.  Appropriate 
involvement and/or interaction with EMSA, the conditions for making available, for re-using 
and exploiting the results (including IPR) by the said entities must be addressed during the 
project implementation. Proposals are encouraged to connect with and contribute to both the 
EU Mission Restore our Ocean and Waters and the UN Decade of Ocean Science for 
Sustainable Development 2021-2030.

Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Reinforcing EU strategic autonomy by reducing non-EU dependencies on critical space 
EEE components and related technologies across their entire supply chain; 
• Providing unrestricted access to critical space EEE components and related technologies 
relevant for EU space missions; 
• Developing or regaining capacity to operate independently in space by developing 
resilient space EEE components and related technologies supply chains, relying on EU 
supply chains and/or trustable and reliable supply chains not affected by non-EU export 
restrictions; 
• Enhancing competitiveness by developing products and capabilities reaching equivalent 
or superior performance level than those from outside the EU and compete at worldwide 
level; 
• Opening new opportunities for manufacturers by reducing dependency on non-EU 
export restricted technologies.   
Scope: Unrestricted access to state-of-art space EEE components and related technologies is a 
pre-requisite for the EU space industry responding to EU space missions. However, especially 
for some families of components, the available solutions in EU do not meet the current high-
performance space requirements. Currently, alternative products sourced from outside EU, are 
either affected by non-EU export control, that limits its use, or present challenges in terms of 
trustable supply chains for the implementation of EU space missions with a security 
dimension. 
Within the frame of this topic, it is expected to finance and implement development projects 
aiming at maturing critical space EEE components with the final goal of lowering the 
dependency from outside EU. This will be done by establishing a long-term sustainable 
supply chain for supporting EU strategic autonomy in the space sector. The selection of the 
supply chains shall reflect this objective. Therefore, the supply chain shall preferably be built 
fully based in EU and when this can only be achieved partially (i.e. because of lack of current 
EU capabilities for unrestricted advanced semiconductor processes or advanced materials that 
cannot be developed within the project), services procured from outside EU shall nevertheless 
ensure that the overall supply chain will remain trustable and not affected by non-EU export 
control. The latest scenario is subject to the approval of the granting authority. 
Below, the space EEE component and related technologies relevant for this Call. It has been 
identified based on needs related to strategic institutional space programs, inputs from 
European stakeholders and the EU Observatory of Critical Technologies. 
• RISC-V microprocessors on 7nm technology node [Target final TRL 5]

Additional, context information and technical requirements are provided in the Technical 
Requirements Guidance document published on the Funding & Tenders Portal. Space is a low 
volume market affected by a dynamic industrial landscape compared to the terrestrial market 
therefore, technological spin in and/or bilateral collaborations should be enhanced between 
European non-space and space industries. Furthermore, proposed activities should be 
complementary to relevant national or other activities at European level. Complementary 
activities should be clearly identified, described and the proposal should report how the 
complementarity is ensured. 
To achieve the non-dependence objective, applicants are expected to include a dedicated 
proposal’s paragraph covering: 
• The description of the technology and/or technology processes and high-level 
breakdown of the space EEE component supply chain to be used. Applicants should 
demonstrate that the supply chain and final product are free of any legal export 
restrictions or limitations, such as those established in the International Traffic in Arms 
Regulations (ITAR) or equivalent instruments applicable in other non-EU jurisdictions. 
Applicants shall also report, in a dedicated subsection, if and which part of the supply 
chain is affected by non-EU export controls such as the Export Administration regulation 
(EAR) i.e. EAR99. 
• The description of the suitable technology development process that has been identified 
and set up within the consortium for avoiding export restrictions of non-EU states and 
assess vulnerabilities of the supply chain.  
Proposal covering space EEE components and related technology developments that are 
targeting a final TRL equal or higher than 5, shall include a list of proposed applicable 
standards (e.g. EN, ECSS, ESCC, MIL, JEDEC,…) that are considered relevant for 
implementing a formal space evaluation and/or qualification. Additionally, projects that aim 
at a formal space qualification shall deliver the full data pack planned to be submitted to the 
qualification authority. This deliverable shall me marked sensitive and it shall be shared with 
the granting authority (i.e. DG-DEFIS and HaDEA). Products that will successfully complete 
the space evaluation/qualification, either within the EU-COM activity or as a consecutive 
follow up, shall inform DG-DEFIS and engrave on the package the EU flag. 
The proposal must include specific tasks as part of the work plan and related dedicated 
confidential deliverables to be provided within 6 months from the start of the project to the 
relevant Commission DG and Executive Agency (i.e. DG-DEFIS and HaDEA), with the 
objective of:   
1. Analysing and describing, in detail, the full supply chain, each entity and its role in the 
supply chain, level of criticality and, if relevant, identify dependencies from outside EU; 
2. Describing the industrial technical roadmap and a business plan for commercialization 
with accurate understanding of applications needs, space mission insertion, including 
time to market indication, of the developed product.

3. Reporting the list of relevant non-EU export control with extra territorial applicability 
for the specific technology/product under development, independently from the supply 
chain established for the EU-COM project. 
4. Undertaking a comprehensive literature review of the relevant technology/product 
reporting the state-of-the-art and highlighting potential gaps between current EU 
solutions and competition from outside EU.  
Unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority before the grant agreement, beneficiaries 
must ensure that none of the entities that participate as affiliated entities, associated partners 
or subcontractors are established in countries which are not eligible countries or target 
countries set out in the call conditions. 
It is recalled to the applicants that all provisions reported by the Model Grant Agreements, 
related to topics with restricted eligibility conditions, are applied. For example, under this 
light, the consortiums shall ensure that for a period up to 4 years after the end of the action, 
supply and availability of the products and/or processes developed and/or qualified within the 
project (consortium as whole or individual beneficiaries) shall be given to any entity in EU, at 
fair and reasonable market prices, conditions and with no legal restrictions and limitations 
stemming for example from International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), or equivalent 
instruments applicable in non-EU jurisdictions. Additionally, beneficiaries that intend to 
transfer ownership or grant an exclusive licence must formally notify the granting authority 
(i.e. DG-DEFIS and HaDEA) before the intended transfer or licensing takes place and the 
granting authority may up to four years after the end of the action object to a transfer of 
ownership or the exclusive licensing of results.

Readiness Level 
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 5-6 by the end of the project. 
Activities may start at TRL 3. The reference TRL definition is the ISO 
16290:2013 applicable to the space sector. 
Procedure 
The procedure is described in General Annex F. The following exceptions 
apply: 
The granting authority can fund a maximum of one project. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Reinforcing EU strategic autonomy by reducing non-EU dependencies on critical space 
EEE components and related technologies across their entire supply chain; 
• Providing unrestricted access to critical space EEE components and related technologies 
relevant for EU space missions; 
• Developing or regaining capacity to operate independently in space by developing 
resilient space EEE components and related technologies supply chains, relying on EU 
supply chains and/or trustable and reliable supply chains not affected by non-EU export 
restrictions; 
• Enhancing competitiveness by developing products and capabilities reaching equivalent 
or superior performance level than those from outside the EU and compete at worldwide 
level; 
• Opening new opportunities for manufacturers by reducing dependency on non-EU 
export restricted technologies.  
Scope: Unrestricted access to state-of-art space EEE components and related technologies is a 
pre-requisite for the EU space industry responding to EU space missions. However, especially 
for some families of components, the available solutions in EU do not meet the current high-
performance space requirements. Currently, alternative products sourced from outside EU, are 
either affected by non-EU export control, that limits its use, or present challenges in terms of 
trustable supply chains for the implementation of EU space missions with a security 
dimension. 
Within the frame of this topic, it is expected to finance and implement development projects 
aiming at maturing critical space EEE components with the final goal of lowering the

dependency from outside EU. This will be done by establishing a long-term sustainable 
supply chain for supporting EU strategic autonomy in the space sector. The selection of the 
supply chains shall reflect this objective. Therefore, the supply chain shall preferably be built 
fully based in EU and when this can only be achieved partially (i.e. because of lack of current 
EU capabilities for unrestricted advanced semiconductor processes or advanced materials that 
cannot be developed within the project), services procured from outside EU shall nevertheless 
ensure that the overall supply chain will remain trustable and not affected by non-EU export 
control. The latest scenario is subject to the approval of the granting authority. 
Below, the space EEE component and related technologies relevant for this Call. It has been 
identified based on needs related to strategic institutional space programs, inputs from 
European stakeholders and the EU Observatory of Critical Technologies: 
• Connectors [Target final TRL 5-6]  
Additional context information and technical requirements are provided in the Technical 
Requirements Guidance document published on the Funding & Tenders Portal. 
Space is a low volume market affected by a dynamic industrial landscape compared to the 
terrestrial market therefore, technological spin in and/or bilateral collaborations should be 
enhanced between European non-space and space industries. Furthermore, proposed activities 
should be complementary to relevant national and/or other activities at European level. 
Complementary activities should be clearly identified, described and the proposal should 
report how the complementarity is ensured. 
To achieve the non-dependence objective, applicants are expected to include a dedicated 
proposal’s paragraph covering: 
• The description of the technology and/or technology processes and high-level 
breakdown of the space EEE component supply chain to be used. Applicants should 
demonstrate that the supply chain and final product are free of any legal export 
restrictions or limitations, such as those established in the International Traffic in Arms 
Regulations (ITAR) or equivalent instruments applicable in other non-EU jurisdictions. 
Applicants shall also report, in a dedicated subsection, if and which part of the supply 
chain is affected by non-EU export controls such as the Export Administration regulation 
(EAR) i.e. EAR99. 
• The description of the suitable technology development process that has been identified 
and set up within the consortium for avoiding export restrictions of non-EU states and 
assess vulnerabilities of the supply chain.  
Proposal covering space EEE components and related technology developments that are 
targeting a final TRL equal or higher than 5, shall include a list of proposed applicable 
standards (e.g. EN, ECSS, ESCC, MIL, JEDEC,…) that are considered relevant for 
implementing a formal space evaluation and/or qualification. Additionally, projects that aim 
at a formal space qualification shall deliver the full data pack planned to be submitted to the 
qualification authority. This deliverable shall me marked sensitive and it shall be shared with 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 246 of 339 
the granting authority (i.e. DG-DEFIS and HaDEA). Products that will successfully complete 
the space evaluation/qualification either within the EU-COM activity or as a consecutive 
follow up shall inform DG-DEFIS and engrave on the package, or if relevant, die the EU flag. 
The proposal must include specific tasks as part of the work plan and related dedicated 
confidential deliverables to be provided within 6 months from the start of the project to the 
relevant Commission DG and Executive Agency (i.e. DG-DEFIS and HaDEA), with the 
objective of: 
• Analysing and describing, in detail, the full supply chain, each entity and its role in the 
supply chain, level of criticality and, if relevant, identify dependencies from outside EU; 
• Describing the industrial technical roadmap and a business plan for commercialization 
with accurate understanding of applications needs, space mission insertion, including 
time to market indication, of the developed product. 
• Reporting the list of relevant non-EU export control with extra territorial applicability 
for the specific technology/product under development, independently from the supply 
chain established for the EU-COM project. 
• Undertaking a comprehensive literature review of the relevant technology/product 
reporting the state-of-the-art and highlighting potential gaps between current EU 
solutions and competition from outside EU.  
Unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority before the grant agreement, beneficiaries 
must ensure that none of the entities that participate as affiliated entities, associated partners 
or subcontractors are established in countries which are not eligible countries or target 
countries set out in the call conditions. 
It is recalled to the applicants that all provisions reported by the Model Grant Agreements, 
related to topics with restricted eligibility conditions, are applied. For example, under this 
light, the consortiums shall ensure that for a period up to 4 years after the end of the action, 
supply and availability of the products and/or processes developed and/or qualified within the 
project (consortium as whole or individual beneficiaries) shall be given to any entity in EU, at 
fair and reasonable market prices, conditions and with no legal restrictions and limitations 
stemming for example from International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), or equivalent 
instruments applicable in non-EU jurisdictions. Additionally, beneficiaries that intend to 
transfer ownership or grant an exclusive licence must formally notify the granting authority 
(i.e. DG-DEFIS and HaDEA) before the intended transfer or licensing takes place and the 
granting authority may up to four years after the end of the action object to a transfer of 
ownership or the exclusive licensing of results. 
In this topic, the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and

Destination 6: Digital and industrial technologies driving human-centric innovation 
New ways of working, assisted by technologies for physical or cognitive augmentation (exo-
skeletons, digital twins, collaborative AI, virtual and extended reality) will increase 
efficiency, safety and quality of work, provided they are trustworthy, safe and reliable, as well 
as human-centric and free from gender, racial and other social biases by design. Within the 
dynamic context of flexible organisation and process flows, workers will have to be 
empowered to co-create their new forms of working and collaboration within and across 
organisations, through participation, social innovation or living labs, where social economy 
actors and local grassroots initiatives are of particular importance. New job profiles and skills 
will emerge, often requiring digital competence, in addition to social and green skills (e.g. 
awareness of impact, circularity options). Continuous learning, through formal training, on-
the-job learning or being immersed in virtual worlds, combined with appropriate certification 
and reward mechanisms can boost the attractiveness of careers in many sectors, including 
manufacturing. A new dynamic, in the spirit of Industry 5.0, will be brought to the workplace 
through better human interaction with production technologies, open innovation, supporting 
young professionals’ innovations in e.g. manufacturing, as well as participation of new actors, 
such as fablabs. Digital environments and virtual worlds will enable new forms of 
collaboration in generating new product and process ideas, assisted by digital twins and AI, in 
an inclusive, trustworthy and ethical fashion. 
Just like today’s internet, the future internet will drive industrial, social and cultural 
innovation. Destination 6 will develop technologies for an inclusive, gender-equal, 
trustworthy and humancentric internet. This will build on a more resilient, sustainable, and 
decentralised architecture, empower end-users with more control over their data and their 
digital identity, and enable new social and business models that respect European values. The 
destination will also spearhead the use of virtual worlds and digital twins where they can 
make a real difference. Industrial virtual worlds could increase productivity, improve working 
conditions and access to work, and address and anticipate skills gaps for highly complex 
products/services or for safety-critical operations. Smart communities and ‘citiverses’ can 
empower public authorities and people to fulfil their aspirations. To reach the ambitious goal 
of achieving trustworthy AI, ‘compliant by design’ with the AI Act – challenges such as 
accuracy, robustness, transparency and efficiency have to be addressed, along eliminating 
biases in data entry to assure fairness in light of individual differences, e.g. in gender or age, 
and intersectional diversity. Increasing the cognitive level of AI systems (like from combining 
data-driven and symbolic learning) is crucial for their wider uptake and acceptance. Smart 
‘technology-for-trust’ (e.g. blockchain for identity and transaction tracking, AI to counter 
biases, deep-fake recognition, fact checking) will also have a role. The Cluster will focus 
particularly on generative AI (addressing algorithms, data and computational resources), 
foundational models and language technologies to gain strategic autonomy in this area. This is 
expected to trigger a whole range of new applications in entertainment, education and 
commerce, starting with assisted and virtual content production, and on demand synthetic 
media. Beyond these, the possibilities in industrial settings (e.g. robotics, training, process 
planning, quality assurance), in public services and public administrations are largely 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 255 of 339 
untapped. Involvement of social sciences and humanities will help bring benefits and respect 
for European values. Specific measures are needed to allow start-ups and smaller companies 
to use and benefit from AI, data (including by enabling access to the high-performance 
computing power needed), photonics and robotics, and to play an active part in developing the 
next generation of smart technologies within a diverse and open European innovation 
ecosystem. Similarly, the responsible use of AI in science, research and engineering is going 
to be key for keeping up the scientific and technological global competitiveness of the EU. 
These elements will also contribute to the EU’s Apply AI Strategy, a comprehensive approach 
aimed at establishing Europe as a global leader in the development and adoption of AI, by 
fostering a vibrant AI ecosystem and making Europe a hub for AI innovation and growth, 
where world-class AI models are developed and integrated into strategic sectors. This 
initiative is designed to drive innovation, economic growth, and competitiveness, while 
ensuring that the benefits of AI are shared by all. The topics related to Generative AI included 
in this destination will support the implementation of the GenAI4EU initiative included in the 
AI Innovation Package of 24 January 2024, and constitute an integral part of the broader 
Apply AI strategy, aiming to create a cohesive and coordinated approach to AI development 
and adoption, one that promotes European excellence and leadership in this critical field. A 
well-functioning European ecosystem of digital commons, based on open technologies and 
driven by European values, and a thriving culture of collaboration and social innovation are 
essential for ensuring sovereignty, trust and user empowerment. New software engineering 
techniques are needed that are applicable from core to edge and across the entire software 
stack to build the open distributed systems that the cluster envisages. AI-driven as well as 
low-code methodologies will help address shortages of digital skills, increase productivity and 
allow for point-of-use configuration and personalisation. 
This destination is structured around the following headings: 
Virtual Worlds 
The objective of this heading is to gain industrial leadership in Virtual Worlds technology at 
large (eg. eXtended Reality technologies and immersive environments), while ensuring the 
European values of privacy, ethics and inclusiveness. It also aims at advancing immersive 
virtual experiences, supporting a user-centered Web 4.0, and building a sustainable digital 
ecosystem within Europe. The efforts will notably focus on advancing immersive experiences, 
enhancing virtual world technologies, and support the launch of the new European Partnership 
on Virtual Worlds that will drive innovation, access resources, and foster industry 
collaboration across the virtual worlds' value chain. 
AI-GenAI / Data / Robotics 
The GenAI4EU HUB aims to build a vibrant European GenAI ecosystem by fostering 
collaboration, visibility, and innovation across strategic sectors. This initiative supports the 
European Commission's AI Office in creating a trustworthy AI ecosystem that maximizes 
societal and economic benefits. It will coordinate efforts among stakeholders—ranging from 
local GenAI communities and startups to large industries—enhancing the EU’s GenAI impact 
and visibility. Additionally, it will monitor the EU GenAI landscape, assess market needs, and 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 256 of 339 
disseminate findings to foster a cohesive and innovative GenAI environment. The HUB also 
aligns with European partnerships like ADRA, ensuring integration with existing initiatives 
and contributing to the EU’s leadership in AI and GenAI advancements.

Linked to the importance of deploying the results of research and innovation in the Union, in 
order to achieve economic, environmental and social outcomes, a number of topics in this 
Work Programme will support essential efforts in knowledge valorisation and standardisation; 
and in improving access to technology infrastructures. 
International Cooperation 
The proposed international coordination and support actions are aligned with the 
Commission’s international priorities. They will help build strong international digital 
partnerships and promote a human-centred digital agenda. International cooperation will 
further a level playing field and reciprocity while delivering new solutions to digital 
challenges. Through evidence-based advice and joint actions with leading semiconductor 
nations like Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, the USA, Canada, and India, the aim is 
to bolster Europe's role in the global semiconductor value chain. This includes guiding the 
European Commission on research collaborations and policy measures while providing 
factual insights into emerging technologies and global supply chains. In parallel, proposed 
actions will focus on strengthening international cooperation in the semiconductor sector and 
advancing Generative AI (GenAI) initiatives in Africa. The aim would be to empower African 
societies, particularly rural communities and women, by equipping local technology 
companies with the tools to leverage GenAI for innovative solutions in key areas, thereby 
unlocking its potential for social and economic development in Africa.

Procedure 
The procedure is described in General Annex F. The following 
exceptions apply: 
To ensure a balanced portfolio covering the two areas described, grants 
will be awarded to applications not only in order of ranking but at least 
also to two proposals that are the highest ranked within each of the two 
areas described, provided that the applications attain all thresholds. 
 
Expected Outcome: Proposals are expected to contribute to developing core technologies for 
Virtual Worlds, with a focus on better, more realistic and more performant interaction and 
immersion, at application and components levels. The following outcomes are expected: 
• Area A: Better and more realistic immersion through multimodal interaction. Project 
results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcome:        
 Improvement of the multimodal immersion experience combining eXtended 
Reality with advanced and innovative technologies.   
• Area B: Innovative photonics technologies for projection, sensing and perception in 
virtual worlds. Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected 
outcome:         
 Improved performance of microdisplays or sensing devices serving Virtual Worlds 
by using innovative Optics and Photonics technologies.   
Proposals are expected to focus on either Area A or Area B. The area should be clearly 
identified within the proposal. Special attention will be given to proposals (whether Area A or 
Area B) including transdisciplinary research in order to deliver and enhance uptake of 
suitable, accurate, ethical and safe solutions. 
Proposed applications should aim at increasing awareness, acceptance and adoption of virtual 
worlds applications across sectors. 
Scope: Virtual worlds will impact the way people live, work, create and share content, the 
way public administrations interact with citizens as well as the way businesses operate, 
innovate, produce and interact with customers. 
Multimodal interaction and immersion are key dimensions of Virtual Worlds and will be 
supported by innovative optics and photonics technologies to achieve the full potential of 
Virtual Worlds core technologies. 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 258 of 339 
A broader adoption of Virtual Worlds will need better and more realistic immersion and 
interaction, mixing modalities, sensors and actuators for an ever-improved user experience: 
touch, smell, haptics, etc will be better stimulated, bringing users closer to real-world 
sensations, serving Virtual Worlds. 
Many challenges remain to be addressed to realize optics and photonics technical solutions 
that offer high-performance, excellent visual quality, high-quality user experience, and 
sustainable services and devices, for head-mounted displays (HMD), autostereoscopic 
displays or sensing devices. 
Coupled with display and sensing technologies, algorithms and metrics should be considered 
to exploit the underlying light (transportation) models given the utilized modality and address 
e.g. scene representation, content generation, compression, transmission, content 
reconstruction, content-to-display adaptation, or rendering. Moreover, the quality of 
integration, both from a user and technological perspective, will be essential for a broad 
adoption of Virtual Worlds. 
The Area A proposals under this topic should develop and demonstrate novel applications for 
Virtual Worlds that combine several modalities and aim to provide seamless and more 
realistic immersive interactions. Proposals should investigate novel scientific approaches or 
push the limit of existing ones to improve the synchronization and integration of the different 
modalities. 
Proposals should focus on an enhanced use of multimodal technologies, integrating at least 
two modalities within an extended reality application. Modalities include haptics and force-
feedback, vision, touch, smell, speech, etc. 
The Area B proposals should address the development and integration of advanced innovative 
and high-performance Optics and Photonics technologies for display and sensing devices 
serving Virtual Worlds. 
• For displays further improve current high-end microdisplays regarding power 
consumption (<1 mW), device efficiency, resolution (8K and beyond, pixel densities > 
10kppi), high dynamic range (HDR), colour gamut, contrast and refresh rate holding the 
promise for truly immersive experiences; 
• For sensing devices improve accuracy in diverse lighting conditions and with different 
eye physiologies.  
Special attention should be given to the design and fabrication of suited waveguide optics, 
holographic elements, diffractive optics, reflective light guides, freeform optics (including 
micro-optics), or meta-surfaces with optimal optical properties and behaviour; to support the 
required field of view (FoV), to be lightweight and safe for the user, and provide excellent 
colour uniformity and high brightness efficiency; to satisfy the use case requirements for both 
professional use and mass adoption, i.e., be scalable to large volumes and cost-effective; to 
integrate targeted systems seamlessly into mixed-reality devices without increasing bulk or 
reducing comfort. 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 259 of 339 
For both Area A and Area B proposals, the quality of integration, both from a user and 
technological perspective, will be essential for a broad adoption of Virtual Worlds. The 
proposals should include a focus on human perception and experience, from subjective, 
objective, and functional perspectives, and take into account EU values such as inclusivity, 
privacy, security and safety of users and the protection of their personal data, as well as 
diversity. Solutions should guarantee the privacy and rights of individuals and companies and 
ensure secure and trustworthy interactions to deliver and enhance uptake of suitable, accurate, 
ethical and safe solutions. 
The Consortium should pay attention to developing solutions that are reliable, robust and 
interoperable. Proposals should leverage existing open standards and technologies in the 
domain of eXtended Reality, while contributing to ongoing standardisation work. 
Applications should be tested and anchored in real world environments and aimed at least one 
application domain. 
We consider that proposals with an overall duration of typically 36 months would allow these 
outcomes to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and 
selection of proposals requesting other durations. 
Proposals should involve the effective contribution of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) 
disciplines and SSH experts, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing 
the societal impact of the related research activities. 
This topic is implemented through a joint effort from the co-programmed European 
Partnership for Virtual Worlds and the Photonics Partnership and all proposals are expected to

• An early demonstration of the future Web 4.0 architectural framework (including 
protocols and standards) made up of key Open Source internet building blocks in priority 
areas: identity, software supply chain, open hardware, decentralised solutions & virtual 
worlds. 
• The emergence of open and interoperable Web 4.0 and Virtual Worlds supported by EU 
based internet ecosystems centred on EU values and regulatory framework with high 
socio-economic impact, through the application of digital commons technologies and 
other Open Source solutions and open standards in several use cases. 
• Supporting the transition from today’s internet towards Web 4.0 where end-users have 
access to a more personalised and interactive experience through more collaborative, 
decentralised and user-centred approaches. Special attention will have to be given to 
security, scalability, and accessibility issues. 
• New business opportunities and the emergence of new business and sustainability 
models based on Open Source.  
Scope: The aim of this topic is to advance the evolution of the internet towards open and 
interoperable Web 4.0 enabling Virtual Worlds, ensuring seamless user experience navigating 
across platforms by increasing the take up of digital commons technologies and other Open 
Source solutions in Europe. The action will thus leverage the strong and active community of 
European Open Source innovators that can contribute to relevant digital commons to deliver 
on key features of virtual worlds. 
This topic will support early demonstrations for Web 4.0 and its architectural framework, 
through the use of key building blocks where there is sufficient level of maturity and critical 
mass of commons contributors (such as in the context of the Next Generation Internet 
initiative). 
The envisaged Web 4.0 shall be powered by open and decentralised technologies enabling 
interoperability between platforms and networks and freedom of choice for the users. It 
should be developed through Open Source / digital commons and tackle security, scalability 
and sustainability at the core of the technological developments.

Applicants should devise appropriate mechanisms for cooperating with the other projects 
under this action to ensure that they work in a coherent way towards the vision of an open, 
interoperable Web 4.0 
At least one proposal in each of the area defined below will be selected. Proposals should 
clearly identify the area they are addressing. 
Area 1: Identity management  
Proposals will support and facilitate the deployment and adoption of the EU Digital Identity 
Wallet with the testing, community development and packaging of Open Source solutions for 
the issuance and verification of electronic attestations and the provision of eIDAS trust 
services. The aim is to deliver a diversity of Open Source digital solutions and services in 
accordance with the European digital rights and principles, empowering citizens with the 
freedom of choice from many secure digital identity solutions that are aligned with the EU 
regulations. Additionally, to foster and support enterprises to harness the benefits of the EUDI 
wallet and the eIDAS trust services. Examples may include the implementation of EUDI 
wallets for Open Source operating systems, like Linux (for enterprise servers), cloud-based 
wallets, laptop-based wallets, Open Source Operating System for mobile devices. 
Furthermore, technical solutions and services for secure and anonymous digital payments and 
money transfers between people, solutions for the implementation for attestation issuers and 
verifiers and the eIDAS trust services with a focus on the development of Open Source stacks 
for issuers and relying parties (for issuing and verifying electronic attestations), especially 
as/for cloud services. When relevant, proposals may address the validation of physical 
documents, either IDs or other types of identity-related documents, such as breeder 
documents. 
Area 2: Software Supply Chain security  
Trusted frameworks are essential to keep the software supply chain secure, as demonstrated 
by the recent attack on XZ Utils. The aim is to strengthen the security of the software supply 
chain by leveraging related NGI building blocks and package solutions for example for 
traceability of code, collaborative trust models among contributors and users, detection of 
anomalous behaviour, construction of software bill of material. Use cases include developers 
and users of codes, DevSecOps team, corporate IT, Open Source projects, industry and/or 
parties that need to be compliant with the Cyber Resilience Act. 
Area 3: Open Hardware  
Open Hardware is key for supporting trust and sovereignty as it allows users to inspect, 
modify, and implement freely the designs. The aim is to support the uptake of Open Hardware 
chips and tools through prototyping, productization and integration in real life cases. 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 265 of 339 
Proposals can address several re-usable tools and components such as controllers, processors, 
or network chips. Use cases include consumer devices for immersive virtual worlds, industry 
applications, consumer devices, smart cities. 
Area 4: Alternative solutions to centralised platforms  
As EU legislation places obligations on platforms, particularly focusing on gatekeepers, it is 
important to prioritize nurturing and enriching credible alternatives. Proposals in this area 
could cover integrating, testing and operation of Open Source decentralised solutions offering 
credible alternatives to users supporting the emergence of Web 4.0 and Virtual Worlds 
experience. Examples include instant messaging, application stores, or productivity 
groupware that should showcase virtual worlds interoperability, trust, resilience, and 
scalability. The focus should be made on decentralised and federated solutions based on 
interoperability requirements and on open standards to ensure to not only meet regulatory 
demands but also foster a more open, diverse, resilient, and competitive digital ecosystem. 
Area 5: Web 4.0 demonstration for Virtual Worlds 
Web 4.0 technologies enabling interoperability and transferability across platforms are crucial 
to ensure various players to contribute to virtual worlds as opposed to a mono-provider 
environment. This area will make use of existing Open Source building blocks for ensuring 
trust, interoperation, interconnection, transaction (including tokens), and resource access in 
Virtual Worlds applications and services. Proposals will aim at integrating the various 
building blocks, with a special focus on interoperability and will demonstrate seamless 
interactions (for example when browsing and searching across multiple providers) in one or 
two selected scenarios. 
For all areas, proposals should innovate beyond the state-of-the-art and could include 
development, integration, testing, deployment, uptake, and operations activities. 
Proposals should encourage, when relevant, open access to data, standardisation activities, as 
well as an IPR regime and sustainability model ensuring lasting impact and reusability of 
results.

and high-risk dependencies which put at risk the attainment of its 
ambitions. For this reason, participation is limited to legal entities 
established in Member States, Iceland and Norway, associated countries 
and OECD countries. 
For the duly justified and exceptional reasons listed in the paragraph 
above, in order to guarantee the protection of the strategic interests of the 
Union and its Member States, entities established in an eligible country 
listed above, but which are directly or indirectly controlled by a non-
eligible country or by a non-eligible country entity, shall not participate 
in the action. 
Legal and

coordination, impact and visibility of the GenAI4EU initiative216 across diverse sectors. This 
CSA should be prepared, managed and coordinated by the key stakeholders in this field, in 
particular those active in developing local GenAI communities, tech transfer, attracting 
investment, and making the European GenAI stakeholders visible. 
Serving as a hub for collaboration, this project seeks to streamline efforts in developing high-
impact GenAI-based applications while fostering cooperation among various GenAI 
stakeholders, from startups, academia and large user industries, including large IT suppliers 
and integrators. 
It will support all the Horizon Europe Pillar 2 clusters, in addressing their policy needs 
through the implementation of the GenAI4EU initiative, in particular in supporting 
mechanisms to pool efficiently and make sufficient data of high quality available (in 
particular from the European Data Spaces, but exploiting other sources of data as 
appropriate), and facilitate collaboration with the AI Factories. 
The proposed project is expected to involve close collaboration and coordination among the 
projects implementing GenAI4EU, developing a strong community. It should also help them 
to maximise their impact and increase their visibility. 
It should also foster the uptake in all strategic application sectors, namely the ones addressed 
in the GenAI4EU initiative, including the 14 industrial ecosystems 217 , in stimulating 
collaborations between the European developers and users. 
The selected proposal will foster collaboration between the AI Factories, the Data Spaces (as 
well as other data providers) and the SIMPL infrastructure, in establishing mechanisms to 
make data available in the AI factories, in particular for the training, and possibly fine-tuning 
of large GenAI models, while respecting IP or privacy/GDPR of the entities/industries 
providing their data. This should build on relevant initiatives, such as data intermediation 
services, with a view of using a trusted third party to ensure no exchanges between industry 
competitors for instance, while defining mechanisms to access (and if needed pooling of) 
critical amount of data, required for the training of very large models. This will require 
mobilisation of industries owning large sets of data, defining with them such mechanisms 
acceptable to all, and implementing them through secure infrastructures, protocols, 
interoperability mechanisms, within the various projects implementing GenAI4EU in the 
various clusters. 
The proposal will also support Common European Data Spaces to coordinate standard setting 
approaches for further data sharing and data interoperability among them or with the AI 
Factories.

The 14 strategic industrial ecosystems identified in the European Industrial strategy (Strategy - 
European Commission (europa.eu)) are: construction, digital industries, health, agri-food, renewables, 
energy intensive industries, transport and automotive, electronics, textile, aerospace and defence, 
cultural and creative culture industries, tourism, proximity and social economy, and retail 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025

Part 7 - Page 272 of 339 
The selected proposal will also ensure collaboration between the GenAI4EU projects, and the 
relevant the AI Factories, for the computing resources, and the data spaces. Moreover, a few 
specific working groups among stakeholders should be established in key European industrial 
/ application sectors (such as in Robotics / Manufacturing, Automotive, energy, 
pharmaceuticals, etc.). Their aim will be to bring together key stakeholders of the sector (incl. 
startups / SMEs and large companies) and foster discussions among them for stimulating their 
cooperation in developing GenAI models relevant for their sector, but also on how to address 
access to existing large data sets, incl. their interoperability and use for GenAI models and/or 
any other elements necessary for enabling an effective development and further grow of the 
sector’s GenAI ecosystem. 
The proposal will also ensure connection with the AI on Demand platform providing support 
for fine-tuning pre-trained models and developing innovative downstream applications, the 
GenAI4EU Skills, and relevant activities implemented under the EU’s Digital Europe 
Programme, Horizon Europe Programme as well as national activities. The selected proposal 
is also expected to build on or seek collaboration with existing and upcoming projects and 
develop synergies and ensure complementarities with other relevant European, national or 
regional initiatives, funding programmes and platforms. 
The CSA is expected to constantly monitor the way the EU GenAI ecosystem, including the 
AI factories, is developing. More broadly, the selected proposal will act as a global 
observatory for GenAI conducting a comprehensive landscape analysis of GenAI, including 
data on market, research, funding, patent and more broadly the state of the advancement of 
GenAI in the EU and worldwide. This includes an inventory of use cases, capabilities, 
evaluation tools and methods to assess generative AI models. The selected proposal is 
expected to widely disseminate this analysis at least twice a year to the stakeholders, 
including the EU, the Member States and Associated Countries. 
It will also assess the uptake of GenAI by large European industry (including technology 
suppliers and user industry), and mobilise them to engage in GenAI4EU initiatives and drive 
the future strategy for the development and uptake of GenAI solution “made in Europe” in all 
strategic industries. 
By identifying prioritized sectors and sharing best practices, the project aims to bridge 
existing gaps, connect stakeholders and foster innovation uptake. 
Furthermore, the selected proposal will assess potential areas that require further R&D, 
including coordination with national initiatives, to ensure comprehensive coverage and 
collaboration. It will actively engage in networking and community animation to foster 
knowledge exchange and collaboration among stakeholders. 
When possible, proposals should build on and reuse public results from relevant previous 
funded actions. Communicable results should be shared with the European R&D community 
through the AI-on-demand platform, and if necessary, other relevant digital resource 
platforms to bolster the European AI, Data, and Robotics ecosystem by disseminating results 
and best practices.

• Increased development and adaptation of standards to meet new industrial needs, 
particularly in critical technology areas, driven by EU and national research. 
• Increased uptake of new technologies through enhanced standardisation activities.  
Scope: Standards are crucial in ensuring the safety, functionality, and interoperability of EU 
products. They help maintain compliance with policy and legal requirements while also 
enabling access to global markets when they are cutting-edge and established through 
international organisations. This highlights the important role that standards play in the EU's 
policy agenda, particularly in initiatives like the Digital Decade, the New Industrial Strategy 
for Europe, the Commission’s EU standardisation strategy 219 , the Communication on 
Advanced Materials for Industrial Leadership 220  and the Communication on European 
Economic Security Strategy221. Future Commission actions – whether it is the implementation 
of legal frameworks like the AI and Data Act or the roll-out of the Commission 
Recommendation on critical technology areas222 for the EU’s economic security – will depend 
on standards. 
To maximize the impact of R&I, early integration of standardisation, as recommended in the 
Code of Practice on standardisation223, is crucial for aligning innovations with policy goals 
and enhancing market competitiveness. 
This action aims to create a full-fledged standardisation mentoring scheme, by providing 
expert services to European projects to valorise project results by contributing to the creation 
or revision of standards. The action should take into account the achievements and lessons 
learnt of the Horizon Standardisation Booster (HS Booster) pilot, which is running from April 
2022 to March 2025. In line with the EU Standardisation Strategy, the HS Booster aims to 
increase the impact of European standardisation resulting from Horizon 2020 and Horizon 
Europe projects by designing, launching, and managing a dedicated service for beneficiaries. 
To further support the valorisation of project results, the full-fledged Standardisation Booster 
will assist beneficiaries, primarily, but not exclusively, in the technology domains identified 
by the Commission Recommendation on critical technology areas224, whose research results 
appear to lead to the revision or creation of a standard. This service will involve testing the 
relevance of their results for standardisation activities. 
The premium service concept of the currently running Horizon Booster pilot has a proven 
track record of providing pertinent support. A similar, high-quality concept is fundamental for 
a booster successor. It is crucial that such a service increases the number of European 
standards, compared with the ongoing service scheme. Therefore, the HSbooster.eu platform 
and tools should be further developed, promoted, and utilised to reach their full potential.

Education and training are prerequisites for a successful and mutually beneficial relationship 
between R&I and standardisation. A future booster should increase the use of the existing 
Training Academy, continuously add new elements based on user feedback and data tracking, 
and be further developed and advertised to enhance usage. 
Scaling and full implementation at the member state level are paramount for a booster to 
create significant and long-term impact. Therefore, besides ongoing and closed Horizon 2020 
and Horizon Europe projects, and other EU-funded projects, the Booster will be open to 
national publicly funded R&I projects. The service will help these beneficiaries engage with 
standardisation bodies and contribute primarily to the creation of standards through 
preparation and elaboration of standardisation activities, such as participating in focus groups, 
setting up new technical committees, drafting technical specifications or technical reports. 
Applicants can vary widely, including standard development organisations, research and 
technology organisations (RTOs), universities, private companies, SMEs, industrial partners, 
innovation agencies and national metrology institutes. The project may benefit from being 
addressed by a consortium that is formed by experts in standardisation, able to support 
Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe, and other publicly funded project beneficiaries.

Expected Outcome:  
• Provide an information tool on the standardisation landscape accessible for all actors of 
the R&I ecosystem which includes a search instrument for standardisation deliverables 
at national, European and international level; 
• Improve valorisation mechanisms for ensuring the market relevance and scalability of 
R&I results.   
Scope: Standards play a pivotal strategic role, serving as the silent foundation of our Single 
Market, ensuring a high-level of safety, functionality and inter-operability for EU products. 
They guarantee adherence to policy and legal objectives. At the same time, standards can 
facilitate access to global markets when they are state-of-the-art and developed within 
international organisations. This underscores the significant role of standards on the EU 
policy agenda, including initiatives such as the European Green Deal, Digital Decade, New 
Industrial Strategy for Europe, the Commission’s EU standardisation strategy 226, and the 
Communication European Economic Security Strategy 227. Future Commission actions – 
whether it is the implementation of legal frameworks, like the AI and Data Act or the roll-out 
of the Commission Recommendation on critical technology areas for the EU’s economic 
security – will depend on standards. 
To support the valorisation of research and innovation results, it is essential to ensure that 
investments in R&I fully leverage the substantial benefits of standardisation for policy and 
legal objectives. In line with the Commission Recommendation on a Code of Practice on 
standardisation228, structured information on the existing standardisation landscape should be 
accessible for R&I actors. This is crucial as available information is fragmented, 
standardisation processes are often uncoordinated, and financial impacts are insufficiently 
understood. 
Furthermore, the diverse array of standard development organisations contributes to a varied 
landscape, each with distinct procedures, priorities, and stakeholders. This decentralised 
approach often results in duplicated efforts, and difficulties in navigating the plethora of 
available standards. Moreover, the absence of a centralised database or repository makes it 
challenging for researchers to access relevant standards efficiently, hindering their ability to 
incorporate standardisation into their research and innovation endeavours effectively. 
The overarching objective of the action is to develop a landscape analyses tool supporting all 
actors in the R&I ecosystem in identifying relevant existing standards. This will enable R&I 
actors to consider the existing standards landscape as a key state-of-the-art input when 
planning their R&I project activities, thereby avoiding reinventing the wheel. The tool to be 
developed shall include mechanisms to keep the standards up-to-date automatically as far as

possible. In addition, state of the art standards give new impetus for technological 
developments and help R&I actors comply with existing regulatory frameworks. Efforts 
should be made to develop standards that align with international and European standards, as 
well as with industrial and commerce consortia, to reduce the number of standards and have a 
broader acceptance. 
In order to develop such a comprehensive open-access information tool effectively benefitting 
a variety of R&I actors, the project should be carried out by experts representing different 
stakeholders covering industry, academia and standard development organisations.

• Use AI to deliver valorisation roadmaps, business plans, partnerships and guide market 
uptake strategies in at least 100 use cases of research-based innovative solutions 
addressing societal challenges.   
Scope: Artificial intelligence and machine learning present enormous opportunities to use 
scientific knowledge and research results faster and more effectively to create value, develop 
new products and services and address the needs of our societies. Despite leading in many 
fields of scientific research, Europe falls short in innovation and valorisation performance 
(what is known as “the innovation paradox”). Harnessing the power of AI to guide the efforts 
of researchers and innovators to bring results to the market, make their research more 
responsive to the needs of society and provide knowledge to inform public policies, can 
significantly contribute to addressing the innovation paradox. From results scouting to patent 
drafting, the role of AI to support knowledge valorisation presents ever-growing possibilities. 
One of the main reasons hampering valorisation of the knowledge generated by R&I actors in 
Europe is that researchers and innovators are not always aware of the valorisation 
opportunities of their research results and may struggle to adopt a concrete plan on how to 
generate value from their research. 
This topic aims to support R&I actors to use AI to support the uptake of research results by 
market and society. This entails the identification of appropriate existing tools and 
instruments and the testing of AI -powered valorisation plans in at least 100 cases. 
The action will provide an AI -powered valorisation toolbox, which will take into account EU 
policy and regulations on AI-ethics, as well as social sciences and humanities aspects, and can 
be used by researchers and innovators to identify the opportunities for valorisation as well as 
for guiding them towards market and societal uptake. This may include using AI for assessing 
feasibility under conditions, investigating legal frameworks that may be relevant to the uptake 
of the solutions, providing guidance on supporting instruments and funding mechanisms, 
supporting matching with investors, providing knowledge on the sector, investigating 
institutional and cultural aspects, citizens and consumer preferences. The use of AI may also 
focus on the efficient use of intellectual assets to raise awareness and guide R&I actors for the 
smart management of intellectual assets. 
The action will also support multistakeholder collaboration for valorisation, by identifying 
and promoting dynamic stakeholder interaction opportunities to optimise outreach and 
engagement, e.g. by engaging SMEs, social enterprises, NGOs and local communities. 
Drawing of the testing of at least 100 cases of AI- powered valorisation from research results 
to the market, the action will also develop a knowledge base for insights and best practices, 
principles and guidance to ensure a responsible use of AI for knowledge valorisation 
benefiting society.

The aim of this topic is to strengthen EU capacity to respond to complex and urgent 
challenges through research and innovation, increase industrial and economic competitiveness 
and make transdisciplinary research deliver for society. This entails testing the effectiveness 
of at least 10 transdisciplinary valorisation pilots to “be ready” for scale up across Europe. 
The trans-disciplinary and cross-sectoral scale-up pilots will use mature results from research 
and innovation while simultaneously unlocking untapped value-creation opportunities and 
promoting collaboration of many different stakeholders from the early stages. Competition 
among the 10 pilots may be promoted to enhance their quality and help identify the highest 
potential impact to the Union’s industrial competitiveness, for example through a voting -
based mechanism. In the preparatory to the potential scale-up phase, the pilots will also 
provide new insights to the possibilities and challenges of transdisciplinary approaches to 
address complex challenges and to the skills, resources and tools needed. Within the scope of 
the topic are also targeted trainings for cross-disciplinary projects with scale-up potential, as 
well as other methodological tools and guidelines. This may also include best practices in 
harnessing the power of cross-disciplinary and cross-sectoral collaboration to enhance 
capacity, drive innovation, and unlock new opportunities for value creation across industry, 
academia, and the public sector.

Expected Outcome: The projects funded under this topic will have the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Provide evidence and understanding of the European landscape of Technology 
Infrastructures, including existing facilities and their services; 
• Develop a sound understanding of the specific needs of industrial users for Technology 
Infrastructures; 
• Improve availability of Technology Infrastructures facilities and strengthen the provision 
of services for enterprises across the EU, in particular SMEs and start-ups, with 
increased opportunities for testing, up-scaling and deployment of new technologies; 
• Make Technology Infrastructures in Europe stronger and more resilient with improved, 
strategic service offer, better adapted to user needs; 
• Strengthen the innovation and technology development capacity of the European 
industry; 
• Contribute to the validation of a European approach to Technology Infrastructures, test 
different strategies and instruments, and their feasibility, to address availability and 
service gaps at EU level, as well as learn from their implementation experience.   
Scope: Proposals should identify a specific technology area or industrial ecosystem in which 
they will implement the activities proposed for a pilot initiative. This should take into account 
the selection criteria for pilot actions developed in the final report of the Commission Expert 
Group on Technology Infrastructures232 and could cover the priority areas proposed in this 
report. 
The proposals should cover different strategic steps needed to lead to and achieve the 
expected outcomes, depending on the starting point for the proposed area, building on earlier 
analysis and consultations.233  
The proposed actions should lead to a comprehensive understanding of the landscape of 
Technology Infrastructures, provide evidence of their benefits and added value in the area 
covered by the proposal, and of any specific needs to improve their availability, accessibility 
and impact. The actions should also identify possible barriers to addressing the identified 
needs.  
The activities should in particular build on or carry out a detailed mapping of the available 
Technology Infrastructures in Europe in the pilot area covered by the proposal, and the 
analysis of main types of services offered and used. The actions should result in an in-depth

understanding of user needs for Technology Infrastructures in relevant industrial ecosystems 
as well as identify the potential gaps in Technology Infrastructures services or mismatch 
between supply and demand, both in terms of the types of facilities and services offered and 
their availability across the entire EU. This analysis should consider both the current state of 
play and a forward-looking perspective, as well as needs of large companies, SMEs and start-
ups. 
The proposed actions should include development of a strategy, roadmap or agenda with 
identified measures that would help overcome the existing gaps and barriers. In particular, the 
actions should identify measures needed to improve infrastructures service provision to 
industry, including their outreach strategies and pricing policies, facilitate access to these 
services and increase their visibility, especially across regions and countries, as well as 
identify potential investment priorities.  
Such a strategy could include for example the specifications for new or upgrade of existing 
TIs, development and deployment of new TI services, developing EU-level networks or 
ecosystems of TIs with integrated service offers, including both technology and non-
technology services (e.g. technical assistance and training services for companies in the 
technologies and services offered by the TIs, support to standardisation, financing, market 
analysis or addressing regulatory issues). 
The pilot projects should develop proposals for implementation modalities of the proposed 
strategy, roadmap or agenda, including the part of the infrastructure operators/owners as well 
as suggested actions and/or support measures at the EU, national, regional level, potentially 
leading to the establishment of an appropriate coordination mechanism. As a basis, a mapping 
of already available support measures at EU and national/regional levels should be carried 
out, as well as identification of relevant actors needed to implement the strategy, roadmap or 
agenda, and the necessary financial resources, as relevant. 
Successful proposals will demonstrate the relevance of the technology areas or industrial 
ecosystems they choose to cover for EU competitiveness and strategic autonomy as well as 
the need for action in these areas. They will involve all relevant stakeholders including in 
particular industrial partners, including SMEs and large enterprises, organisations hosting 
Technology Infrastructures and other infrastructures offering relevant services for industry, as 
well as technology, market and legal experts as needed. 
Projects should build on or seek collaboration with relevant existing projects and develop 
synergies with other relevant European, national or regional initiatives, funding programmes 
and platforms.

to strengthen the connection between research and industry through technology transfer, 
lowering the risks for private R&I investments.  
Scope: Proposals should put forward a robust methodology to comprehensively analyse the 
current landscape of Technology Infrastructures facilities and services available in Ukraine 
and assess the damages to such capacities in result of the war. To this end, the proposed 
activities should engage with Ukrainian authorities at national and regional level as well as 
relevant organisations within the R&I ecosystems, such as RTOs, technical universities, 
research institutes and technology centres, hosting such infrastructures. 
Activities proposed under this action should include a comprehensive analysis of user needs 
for Technology Infrastructures, both in the public and the private sector. This analysis should 
take into account in particular strategic technologies and long-term development needs of the 
Ukrainian economy. 
This should lead to an analysis of capacity gaps and the mismatch between supply and 
demand for Technology Infrastructure facilities and services. 
Building on these analyses, the project funded under this action will develop an investment 
agenda for Technology Infrastructures in Ukraine in view of the post-war reconstruction of 
the country. This agenda should identify priority areas for investments as well as the type of 
investments that are most urgently needed to foster the innovation capacity of the Ukrainian 
economy. It could also propose specific large-scale investments in individual facilities, 
development and deployment of new TI services, developing national networks or ecosystems 
of TIs with integrated service offers, building partnerships with TIs operating in the EU, as 
well as other actions strengthening the provision of TI services in Ukraine. 
The action funded under this call should identify a set of Technology Centres in Ukraine that 
would pilot the establishment of an integrated network providing Technology Infrastructure 
services is selected technology area or industrial ecosystem. Such a network should include a 
critical mass of RTOs, universities and research institutes, as well as the private sector as 
relevant, that would develop a joint offer of research and technology services and other 
business support services to Ukrainian companies. Based on this pilot, the project should also 
develop a strategy and actional plan of scaling-up such networks on regional, national and 
international levels. 
Methodologies proposed under the activities envisaged in this action should take into account 
the relevant work carried out at EU level as well as build on the experience of EU 
organisations hosting such facilities. Proposals should ensure strong engagement from all 
relevant stakeholders in the public and the private sector. 
Projects should build on or seek collaboration with relevant existing projects and develop 
synergies with other relevant national, European or international initiatives on Technology 
Infrastructures, such as for example Open Innovation Test Beds, Testing and Experimentation 
Facilities or European Digital Innovation Hubs.

Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected 
outcomes: 
• African societies benefit from innovative solutions on GenAI applied to key areas: 
• Local technological companies in some locations in Africa benefit from the 
technological capacity to develop targeted solutions to unlock the full potential of GenAI 
Digital in key areas with the primary focus on rural communities in Africa and women, 
being an underrepresented group but with a key role in the foundation of these societies.  
Scope: Generative AI (GenAI) holds the potential of creating in Africa a rich ecosystem of 
transformative solutions and practical applications addressing the specific societal challenges 
and opportunities most of the countries are facing. 
The proposals should address one or more of the following: 
• Agriculture optimisation: GenAI can analyse satellite imagery and sensor data to 
monitor state of crops, soil conditions, and weather patterns, enabling farmers to boost 
crop yields and enhance food security through sophisticated predictive analytics and 
efficient resource management like water and pesticides. This is crucial to mitigate 
climate change and poor irrigation infrastructures in some areas of Africa. 
• Healthcare: GenAI can diagnose diseases from medical images and patient data, 
enhancing healthcare in remote areas; forecast disease outbreaks and aid in preventive 
planning, and with the help of chatbots and virtual assistants can offer medical advice 
and connect patients with doctors, expanding telemedicine services, making healthcare 
more accessible to remote populations. Particular attention should be paid to the gender 
dimension in addressing AI biases, sex-specific healthcare needs, and intersecting gender 
and racial inequalities in health and access to health services. 
• Infrastructure and urban planning: GenAI optimises energy usage, integrates renewables, 
and ensures efficient distribution, while managing water (including groundwater but also 
rainfall use) and waste (e.g. plastic reduction and reuse) effectively for sustainability, 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 291 of 339 
and enhancing safety with real-time incident detection. It also provides support for 
reconstruction following natural or human-made disasters. This is vital for some African 
communities with scarce natural resources like water and facing high temperatures by 
using Digital Twins on urban and rural areas. All these technological solutions depend 
strongly on the existence and quality of connectivity infrastructure, as a key enabler for 
unlocking the Digital and Green Transition. 
• Digital Skills and learning: Generative AI can personalize learning paths, create 
multilingual educational content, and offer on-demand virtual tutoring, benefiting rural 
communities with low resources and fully relying on mobile phones to access online 
services. Additionally, adaptive learning platforms can use data analytics to tailor 
teaching, while engineers craft queries to help AI models understand local languages and 
nuances to set up conversational chatbots for local communities.  
The proposals should approach these objectives by: 
• Conducting an evidence-based analysis to identify particular needs in Africa that GenAI 
technologies could solve, for one or several of the topics mentioned above. 
• Identifying solutions on GenAI developed in the EU that could be applied in Africa for 
one or several of the topics mentioned above. 
• Based on existing EU-based solutions and particular needs, developing and integrating 
generative Artificial Intelligence models and algorithms specifically adapted for one or 
several of the abovementioned key areas. 
• Involving and supporting start-ups and local networks in 3 to 5 locations in Africa to 
create innovative solutions to uniquely African challenges in those areas based on 
GenAI. Co-creation and living lab methodologies should be explored to boost social 
uptake of proposed solutions. Living labs are ecosystems of experimentation and open 
innovation, with a systematic approach to co-creation among their users, whether they 
are researchers, businesses, civil society or public administrations. These open 
innovation spaces will enable researchers and local actors from the public and private 
sectors work together using digital technologies to co-create knowledge and solutions 
that respond to their societal needs, while improving territorial cohesion. 
• The approved projects should take into account the AI Act and GDPR as the main legal 
frameworks to ensure data protection of the data used within third countries.  
Where relevant proposals are encouraged to build on, or seek collaboration with, existing 
projects and develop synergies with other relevant European initiatives. In particular links are 
encouraged with the projects funded under international cooperation on AI for public good, in 
the areas of health, digital twin for reconstruction, emergency response and electric grid 
optimisation, Destination Earth, Copernicus.

14. European Standardisation Panel Survey 
Expected outcome: 
The European Standardisation Panel Survey (ESPS) will be designed to collect data on 
standardisation activities of companies. The ESPS aims to create a comprehensive dataset to 
analyse the standardisation activities of innovation ecosystem actors and to identify trends for 
use by standardisation policy makers and stakeholders, including standard development 
organisations. The ESPS will also contribute to assessing how public R&I funding addresses 
the standardisation needs of industry. The current action is the second edition of the survey. 
The ESPS will serve as input for scientific research on the standardisation activities of 
companies and the implementation of standards, providing essential intelligence for further 
valorisation policy measures. The survey results can also be used to develop strategies for 
involvement in European and international standardisation, facilitating the identification of 
new trends. 
The analysis will complement the Code of Practice on standardisation and the first edition of 
the ESPS by raising awareness of the importance of standardisation for businesses. 
Scope: 
For businesses, standardisation serves as a strategic tool by preparing the market for a new 
product, even if the new product is still in the early stages of development. 
Despite progress in recent years, standardisation research, with all of its facets – from creation 
through the development process to implementation – remains less pivotal compared to 
innovation research. This is primarily due to the lack of comprehensive empirical data, despite 
excellent theoretical reviews on the topic. Following the successful implementation of the first 
edition of the ESPS, there is a need to expand the geographical scope by ensuring full 
participation from more EU Member States. This action will also allow for comparative 
analytics and trend analysis of the data from the different editions. 
Against this background, a second ESPS will be launched to collect and analyse data from 
European companies and research institutions in the field of standardisation.

conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
In order to achieve the expected outcomes, and safeguard the Union’s 
strategic assets, interests, autonomy, or security, namely avoiding a 
situation of technological dependency on a non-EU source, in a global 
context that requires the EU to build on its strengths and to carefully 
assess and address strategic weaknesses, vulnerabilities and high-risk 
dependencies, participation is limited to legal entities established in 
Member States. Proposals including entities established in countries 
outside the scope specified in the call/topic/action will be ineligible. 
For the duly justified and exceptional reasons listed in the paragraph 
above, in order to guarantee the protection of the strategic interests of 
the Union and its Member States, entities established in an eligible 
country listed above, but which are directly or indirectly controlled by a 
non-eligible country or by a non-eligible country entity, may not 
participate in the action unless it can be demonstrated, by means of 
guarantees 
positively 
assessed 
by 
their 
eligible 
country 
of 
establishment, that their participation to the action would not negatively 
impact the Union’s strategic assets, interests, autonomy, or security. 
Entities

The granting authority can fund a maximum of one project. 
The evaluation committee could 
be partially composed by 
representatives of EU institutions. 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
The beneficiaries may provide financial support to third parties (FSTP). 
The support to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants. 
Activities proposed by third parties (FSTP proposals) are to be selected 
according to selection criteria agreed between the granting authority 
and the beneficiaries. 
A “third party”, submitting a FSTP proposal, could be either an entity 
or a consortium of entities. 
In accordance with article 207 of the EU Financial Regulation the 
maximum amount to be granted to each third party can exceed EUR 
60,000. This derogation is justified by the fact that the foreseen actions 
carried out by third parties will target breakthrough techniques and 
technologies to disruptively improve SST sensors performance and/or 
operations. Indeed, costly hardware (such as radar, optical…) 
development and implementation tests are sought on this topic. 
The minimum amount of each FSTP proposal is expected to be in the 
range of EUR 2 million. 
The funding rate for each FSTP proposal is 80%. Third parties shall be 
asked to co-finance 20% of the total amount of each FSTP proposal. 
The total amount of the EU contribution supporting FSTP proposals is 
expected to be in the range of EUR 14,5 million 
As per Article 16.2 (Ownership of results) of the EU Grants: AGA — 
Annotated Grant Agreement (V1.0– 01.05.2024), the granting authority 
does not obtain ownership of the results produced under the action. 
Similarly, the IPR generated in FSTP activities cannot be retained by 
the beneficiaries. 
 
The rationale behind the proposed set up of this topic is the following: 
The EUSST Partnership (i.e. the identified beneficiary), foreseen in the Space Regulation (art. 
54 -EU 2021/696) composed of 15 Member States, has been created (cf. Implementing 
Decision 2022/1245) in 2022. The EUSST Partnership is entrusted to contribute with their 
national assets to enhance capabilities to monitor, track and identify space objects and space 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 312 of 339 
debris with the aim of further increasing the performance and autonomy of capabilities under 
the SST sub-component at Union level. 
The implementation of the Space Regulation (cf. EU 2021/696) provisions related to the SST 
sub-component, foresees the incorporation of commercial capabilities (Art. 54(1.a) of the 
Space Regulation) so to complement national capabilities. The EUSST Partnership (i.e. the 
FSTP granting authority) will launch an open call for proposals in order to select the best 
FSTP proposals within the proposed scope. 
The current set up of this topic allows to support in priority the development of innovative 
commercial sensors. Nevertheless, in case of low private sector participation on FSTP actions 
the beneficiary (i.e. EUSST Partnership) will be able to use the remaining budget for the 
upgrade and/or development of national sensors applying the same proposed co-funding 
scheme and scope. This logic is reflected in the wording : «The beneficiary MAY provide 
financial support to third parties (FSTP)”. 
Hardware development, prototyping and high TRL requested at the end of the FSTP action (at 
least TRL 5) requires important budgets, well beyond 60k€. Furthermore, it is expected that, 
at the end of FSTP support, the beneficiaries will pursue the developments in order to reach 
the operational stage hence contributing to the overall EUSST sensors network. 
We foresee to have at least 4 FSTP projects ; if there are only, or less than, 4 FSTP projects, 
the remaining budget will be used to upgrade national sensors with novel technologies & 
techniques. The same cofinancing scheme will be applied to national sensors upgrades. 
The overall objective of this Topic is to stimulate fast integration of R&D technologies and 
technics in operational sensors. Co-funding from Third Parties is expected in order to confirm 
their engagement towards the achievement of operational SST capacities. This means that :   
1. Out of the 15M€ indicative budget, 0,5M€ is expected to cover EUSST coordination 
activities (e.g. drafting the FSTP call for proposals SoW, managing the reviews of each 
FSTP action). 
2. Coordination activities are funded at 100%.  
Expected Outcome: Projects developed under this topic are expected to contribute to the 
following outcomes: 
• To reinforce European strategic autonomy and resilience in space surveillance and 
tracking capabilities (sensors and associated data processing) by leveraging innovation 
and competitiveness of the European industry and start-ups 
• To develop and/or improve existing commercially available assets and SST-related 
technologies fostering competition and market development, allowing the European SST 
industry and start-ups to be competitive on global markets. 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 313 of 339 
• To complement, as defined by EUSST Partnership’s architecture studies, existing 
Member States patrimonial SST capacities with European privately-owned ones, 
assuring interoperability and adopting global standards. 
• To improve European SST operational capabilities by supporting the extension of space-
tracking infrastructure located outside continental Europe. 
• To prepare EU industry to capture new SST markets in the domains by proposing 
competitive, cutting-edge sensors.  
Scope: The following sensors and data processing R&I activities, funded through FSTP, 
should be addressed to tackle the above expected outcomes: 
• Novel, cost-effective sensor concepts and technologies capable of detecting, tracking and 
surveying objects in order to improve the state-of-the-art performance according to the 
target orbit regime (e.g. less than 10 cm in LEO, 30 cm in GEO). Note: Priority should 
be given to projects focusing on LEO detection even though preeminent proposals in 
other orbit regimes will be considered. 
• Autonomous sensor concepts to increase operational robustness, to reduce response 
times, to reduce operation costs, amongst others. 
• Tools, techniques, and technologies necessary to significantly improve the efficiency of 
future or existing commercial sensor’s network by streamlining the scheduling and 
tasking of its sensors. 
• State-of-the-art technologies and concepts improving sensors’ tracking and surveillance 
performances (measurements quality (noise; bias; measurements rates ...), tracks 
accuracy (track noise; track duration...), sensors’ field of view… 
• Cost-effective tracking and/or surveillance sensor concepts expanding orbital coverage 
of Member States patrimonial SST capacities and/or meeting commercial market needs. 
• Any promising technology for precise tracking and data processing.  
FSTP proposals are expected to promote cooperation between different actors (industry, 
SMEs and research institutions) and consider opportunities to quickly turn technological 
innovation into commercial use in the space sector. 
FSTP proposals are expected to start between TRL 2 and TRL 4 and reach at least TRL 5 by 
the end of the project. The reference TRL (Technology Readiness Level) definition is the ISO 
16290:2013 applicable to the space sector. 
FSTP proposals under this topic should explore synergies and be complementary to already 
funded actions in the context of technology development at component level. In particular, it 
is expected that FSTP proposals make use of existing European technologies and/or building 
blocks at component level contributing to European non-dependence and strengthen 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 314 of 339 
competitiveness. Furthermore, proposed activities should be complementary to national 
activities and activities funded by the European Space Agency (ESA). 
Financial support to third parties is expected to start no later than 7 months after the start date 
of the grant.

or a consortium of entities. 
In accordance with article 207 of the EU Financial Regulation, the 
maximum amount to be granted to each third party can exceed EUR

Expected Outcome: Projects developed under this topic are expected to contribute to the 
following outcomes: 
• To prepare EU industry and start-ups to capture new SST markets by proposing 
innovative and competitive services. 
• To reinforce European strategic autonomy and resilience in the SST domain by 
leveraging commercial services while enhancing EU SST operational effectiveness. 
• To foster competition and market development in SST-related commercial services 
considering the needs of relevant actors such as, but not limited to, satellites Owners and 
Operators, insurances companies, regulators… 
• To demonstrate and foster the development of an ecosystem of lucrative, advanced, and 
tailor-made commercial services, which may rely on, or be provided on top of, the basic 
public services delivered by EU SST.  

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 317 of 339 
Scope: The R&I areas, funded through FSTP, which should be addressed to tackle the above-
mentioned expected outcomes are: 
• Cost-effective techniques and technologies to develop future SST commercial services 
or to substantially improve existing ones, additional or complementary to the ones 
currently delivered by EU SST. 
• Development or improvement of algorithms for added value services (with respect to EU 
SST public services), for instance: measurements correlation, initial Orbit determination, 
orbit determination, covariance estimation, objects characterisation, application of 
alternative metrics, manoeuvre detection, secure exchanges between Owners/Operators 
(for example taking advantage of, but not limited to, technologies such as AI or 
blockchain). 
• Development of evaluation methods of collision probability applied, but not limited to 
manoeuvrable or non-manoeuvrable objects, including satellite constellations. 
• Improvement of algorithms for data fusion for a more efficient use of data and 
information from the same object coming from different sensors. 
• Expansion or improvement of EU industry proprietary space objects catalogue (targeting 
in priority debris below 10 cm in LEO and below 50 cm in GEO). 
• Development or improvement of new orbit propagation models for efficient propagation 
of the orbital population (e.g. cloud propagation models to propagate the debris cloud 
generated after a collision or fragmentation ...). 
• Development or improvement of simulators including in-orbit objects population and 
sensors, as trade-off support for future commercial services, added value services and 
sensors.  
FSTP proposals are expected to promote cooperation between different actors (industry, 
SMEs and research institutions) and consider opportunities to quickly turn technological 
innovation into commercial use in space. 
FSTP proposals are expected to start at least TRL 2 and reach at least TRL 6 by the end of the 
project – The reference TRL definition is the ISO 16290:2013 applicable to the space sector. 
FSTP proposals under this topic should explore synergies and be complementary to already 
funded actions in the context of technology development at component level. In particular, it 
is expected that FSTP proposals make use of existing European technologies and/or building 
blocks at component level contributing to European non-dependence and strengthen 
competitiveness. Furthermore, proposed activities should be complementary to national 
activities and activities funded by the European Space Agency (ESA). 
Out of the 4M€ indicative budget, 0,2M€ is expected to cover EUSST coordination activities 
(e.g. drafting the FSTP call for proposals SoW, managing the reviews of each FSTP action). 
Coordination activities are funded at 100%.

Topics 
Some activities resulting from this topic may involve using classified 
background and/or producing of security sensitive results (EUCI and 
SEN). Please refer to the related provisions in section B Security — EU 
classified and sensitive information of the General Annexes. 
 
Expected Outcome: The strategic objective of this topic is to support the development of 
capabilities to ‘Act in Space’ through demonstrating in space a pilot mission by 2030 related 
to In-Space Operations and Services (ISOS). The envisaged ISOS pilot mission shall provide 
the necessary seed components for a service infrastructure, available to the European in-space 
ecosystem (including the EU assets), driving the generation of a new in-space economy, 
providing enhanced in-orbit technology demonstration and maximising EU technology non-
dependence. 
This pilot mission will largely contribute to ensure EU’s freedom of action in space, increase 
the resilience and protection of EU assets in space and foster the development of the new in-
space economy. A pioneering, novel and scalable mission concept, which is unique compared 
to other initiatives among all space-faring nations is envisaged. The mission will build on 
previous R&I with an operational mission concept, focusing on application and service 
demonstration, with a concrete view to commercial and governmental usage. The detailed 
mission concept will be derived in close coordination with EU Member States and EEA 
countries through a dedicated ISOS Pilot Mission Advisory Group (PMAG)161. 
This Coordination and Support Action addresses the coordination of the development R&I 
actions for the implementation of the ISOS pilot mission and the support of its evolution 
towards a flagship for commercial and governmental services. 
The project is expected to contribute to the following outcomes, in close and continuous 
coordination with the European Commission services and the ISOS Pilot Mission Advisory 
Group161:

2. ESA.2 - Heading 3 of Space - Using Space on Earth – Telecommunications - IRIS2 
Space infrastructure: Development and Validation 
The Commission has adopted a proposal for a Union Programme for Secure Connectivity. 
The future IRIS² system – Infrastructure for Resilience, Interconnectivity and Security by 
Satellites – should upon the GOVSATCOM component of the EU Space Programme, which 
should also take advantage of additional national and European capacities and develop further 
the European Quantum Communication Infrastructure (EuroQCI) initiative. This action 
should therefore enable and support the development and validation actions for the 
construction of the initial space and ground infrastructure required for the provision of 
governmental services. 
These activities are due to be entrusted to ESA under a Contribution Agreement between the 
Commission and ESA. In particular, ESA will perform the following tasks: infrastructure 
development and validation activities as required to achieve full validation activities 
(including performances) of IRIS2, that will be implemented by the future Concessionaire. 
IRIS² implementation will include system architecture tasks, engineering and design of non-
recurring items, development, manufacturing, security and technology EU non-dependence 
aspects and all necessary qualification and tests of space and ground segments. It will also 
include all the new developments that are needed to achieve the programme’s objectives, as 
well as all the early validations deemed as necessary for an early elimination of the technical 
risks (e.g., interface and functional testing between blocks). 
However, the detailed perimeter of activities for the Entrusted Tasks industrial activities will 
be based on the selected contractors’ final proposal. 
The procurement actions under this section will affect the essential security interests of the 
Union. In accordance with Art. 136 of the EU Financial Regulation, restricted participation 
will therefore be established in the tender specifications. In this case, participation should in 
principle be open only to entities established in the EU Member States. Participation of 
entities established in Horizon Europe associated countries or in third countries will be 
decided on a case-by-case basis. 
Proposals under this topic, aiming or contributing to technology development for EU non-
dependence are expected to be complementary and in synergies with already funded actions 
directly manged by the Commission, in the context of critical space technology for EU non-
dependence developments. In particular, the topics: Critical Space Technologies for EU non-

3. ESA.3 - Heading 11 of Space - Boosting Space through IOD/IOV opportunities - In 
Orbit Demonstration/Validation (IOD/IOV) service 
To ensure EU non-dependence and competitiveness in technologies, there is a clear need for a 
regular, sustainable, cost-effective and responsive In Orbit Demonstration/Validation 
(IOD/IOV) service in the EU. Space flight heritage in real conditions and environment is 
often required to de-risk new technologies, products, concepts, architectures, services and 
operations techniques be that for unique or recurrent, institutional or commercial missions. 
Intended results of the action is to provide a service for regular aggregation (if needed), 
launch and operations in orbit for IOD/IOV experiments; the objective is to have at least one 
opportunity every year during the Horizon Europe implementation period. This will 
contribute to reduce the time to market or operational use of new technologies, products, 
concepts, architectures, and operations techniques. 
The IOD/IOV activities intend to provide a regular and cost-effective service and solution for 
common flight ticket actions (management, spacecraft design including reuse of existing 
solutions, assembly, integration and tests, launch and operations) based on EU solutions both 
for the spacecraft (i.e. platform, experiments aggregation, operations in orbit including 
preparation and associated Ground Segment) and for the launch services. 
The scope of the activities may include mission design, integration and implementation, for 
all the necessary tasks to prepare, provide and operate spacecraft(s), together with the related 
ground segment, which accommodates the selected IOD/IOV experiments as well as the 
associated launch services. 
For the aggregation and operations, the activities include: 
• System studies, at ground and space level, including the compatibility with the available 
launchers; 
• Input to the launch mission analysis performed by the launch service provider; 
• Selection, assembly, integration and testing of the spacecraft(s) and related ground 
segment; 
• Management of interfaces with and between the different IOD/IOV experiments, 
between the spacecraft and the launcher and between the spacecraft and the ground 
segment; 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 328 of 339 
• Preparation of the spacecraft(s) for the flight; 
• In-orbit testing and operations including data provision.  
Concerning launch aspects, IOD/IOV activities should support the European launcher 
exploitation policy, therefore relying as far as possible on EU manufactured launcher 
solutions launched from the EU territory. The actions will include the provision of flight 
opportunities with EU manufactured launchers which encompass the mission analysis, the 
verification of interfaces between the spacecraft and the launcher, the preparation of launch 
campaign and the flight up to the injection of the spacecraft(s) on the required orbit(s). 
These activities and associated procurement actions will be implemented by ESA in line with 
the Contribution Agreement between the Commission and ESA.

Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing 
to overcoming sectorial demand fragmentation and support scale up of the space data251 use, 
increasing the wider uptake and mass adoption of the EU space data in selected priority areas 
that are strategic for Europe. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim to deliver 
results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to some or all of the following 
expected outcomes: 
• Foster the development and prepare for the commercialisation of innovative space-based 
solutions that supports an informed decision making of relevant stakeholders (e.g. 
energy operators, city and regional authorities, financial institutions, insurance 
companies, corporations, food/industrial manufacturing etc.); 
• Leverage EGNSS-based and Copernicus-based capabilities to modernize and increase 
the efficiency and resilience of energy infrastructure and/or urban environment, and/or 
support the use of green financing schemes addressing environmental challenges as well 
as implementing climate resilient practices in the downstream sector; 
• Analyse and support the consolidation of the sectorial demand for solutions based on 
EGNSS and Copernicus services and data, possibly also exploring the synergies with EU 
space based secure communication and surveillance, addressing the challenges identified 
in priority areas and leveraging the relevant regulatory environment.  
Scope: Europe has made a considerable investment in its space infrastructure, resulting in two 
pivotal outcomes: first, a strategic autonomy of the continent, and second, a surge in 
economic growth driven by space-enabled applications. Additionally, Europe boasts a 
thriving sector offering space data, services and products, which continues to show steady 
growth. 
The market for space data and services is fragmented, both on the side of supply and demand. 
A fragmented and underdeveloped demand from both public and private users does not allow 
for scaling up, hindering the realization of the full potential of the EU Space infrastructure. 
Space data can be used in almost all industry verticals in the EU and worldwide. While some 
sectors are already using space data to high extent, providing benefits to the citizens, economy 
and environment, other sectors are only marginally testing the ground. The demand creation is 
progressing, however, in order to foster the space data economy, it is needed to scale up and 
accelerate the market uptake and mass adoption of space data, in the context of the applicable 
legal framework.

Space data relates to data and services provided by the EU Space programme components. 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 332 of 339 
In order to achieve this, the proposals should focus on the development of innovative 
solutions, tailored to the specific needs of downstream industries and verticals and addressing 
inherent sectorial demand fragmentation issues. There is also an untapped potential of using 
space data to bolster green and digital transitions, presenting an opportunity to create 
innovative solutions in these domains. 
Moreover, the projects should leverage the existing relevant sectorial regulations and policies, 
by exploring how the proposed solutions using space data and services can support these 
regulations. 
Projects supporting the integration of EU Space data and services into vertical market 
segments should focus on one of the following selected priority areas (and identify which area 
is being addressed in the proposal): 
• Energy (renewable energy, energy efficiency, energy infrastructure) In the face of 
energy supply shortages and climate change, the demand for renewable energy is rapidly 
increasing. Driving this demand is the fact that renewables are reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions and transitioning the world towards a sustainable future. Moreover, energy 
efficiency initiatives aim to optimize energy consumption across various sectors, from 
manufacturing to residential spaces, fostering a more sustainable and responsible 
approach to energy use. To expedite this transition, space data and services enable 
energy stakeholders to make informed decisions about the deployment and management 
of renewable energy infrastructure and to gain insights into energy consumption patterns 
across diverse sectors and geographic regions. Examples of downstream innovation in 
this context is the use of GNSS and EO technologies to enhance energy infrastructure 
resilience and efficiency in smart grids by adapting to real-time demand changes or to 
facilitate the monitoring and management of electricity distribution networks. 
• Climate adaptation and Environmental footprint reduction: The implementation of 
effective Climate adaptation measures can foster climate resilience and reduce 
vulnerability to climate change, in communities, ecosystems and infrastructure. GNSS 
and EO technologies provide accurate and up to date data for assessing climate risks, 
prioritizing adaptation measures and allocate resources effectively to reduce 
environmental footprint, enabling a deeper understanding of climate change impacts and 
informing effective mitigation strategies. This includes the development of innovative 
downstream applications to prepare and respond effectively, improving disasters 
preparedness through early warning systems for extreme events, strengthening 
biodiversity and ecosystems services, promote afforestation and reforestation, manage 
water resources and water allocation more efficiently, implement climate resilient 
agriculture practices. Moreover, space-based solutions play a crucial role to reduce 
resource consumption, environmental impact, pollution and ecological degradation, 
fostering industry sustainability practices. Proposals should address one or more of the 
aforementioned areas, leverage digital tools based on innovative technologies such as 
AI/Big Data/Quantum/Blockchain/Digital Twins, etc., explore synergies with Satcom, as 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Digital, Industry and Space 
Part 7 - Page 333 of 339 
well as ensure the involvement of private sector as end users for the proposed solution 
and commercial exploitation. 
• Green financing and insurance: Green financing involves the allocation of funds to 
support environmentally sustainable projects. Concurrently, green insurance offers 
coverage for risks tied to sustainability, climate change, and eco-friendly activities. 
These insurance products incentivize responsible practices, providing protection against 
environmental challenges. Both green financing and insurance contribute to fostering 
sustainability by directing financial resources and risk management strategies toward 
initiatives that promote positive environmental and social outcomes. Space technologies 
can play a pivotal role by providing accurate data to ensure transparency, accountability 
and risk management for the assessment and monitoring of environmental projects 
funded by green financing. 
• Liveable cities of the future: The share of the world’s population living in cities is 
constantly increasing. Currently governments have the goal to move cities towards a 
better liveable future. Tomorrow cities can drive and take advantage of innovation and 
new downstream space technologies as they are the biggest digital platform. Solutions 
should develop space-based applications and technologies with focus on commercial 
exploitation for the modernisation of cities. Examples of areas to be analysed are smart 
waste and waste water managements, drinking water management, green constructions, 
urban green, urban mobility and public transports, urban logistics, health and well-being, 
public safety, sustainable tourism, as well as the monitoring of urbanisation patterns (e.g. 
land coverage, urban sprawl, heat islands), assessing the link between urban and peri 
urban/rural areas and interdependencies of cities with their regional areas, improving 
disasters preparedness and preventive/proactive urban planning, supporting investment 
in more climate resilient infrastructures etc. In parallel with modernisation of liveable 
cities another important objective is to preserve the past and valorise the cultural heritage 
trough monitoring sites mitigating the effects of mass tourism, climate change, 
subsidence and pollution. Synergies with satellite communications can also be explored. 
Proposals are expected to ensure the involvement of cities’ authorities as either end users 
or regulatory authorities supporting the uptake of the proposed innovative solutions.  
Each proposal should address only one of the four areas outlined above, which must be 
clearly identified. 
The proposals under this topic should present a business plan. 
Proposals are expected to promote cooperation between different actors (industry, SMEs and 
research institutions, city authorities, and where relevant, Copernicus Entrusted Entities) and 
consider opportunities to quickly turn technological innovation into commercial exploitation. 
When applicable and upon request of the granting authority, the beneficiaries may be asked to 
interact with the EU Space Programme, through the most relevant expert group(s) 
configuration(s), with the purpose of giving feedback about the EU Space Programme. 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025

Part 7 - Page 334 of 339 
Proposals under this topic should explore synergies with Space Based Communication, 
Navigation and Surveillance (CNS) systems, and be complementary to already funded actions 
in the context of technology development at component level. In particular, it is expected that 
projects make use of existing European technologies and/or building blocks at component 
level contributing to European non-dependence and strengthen competitiveness. Furthermore, 
proposed activities should be complementary to national activities and activities funded by the 
European Space Agency (ESA) and if applicable Destination Earth. 
Proposals addressing Galileo PRS (Public Regulated Service) related applications are not in 
the scope of this action. 
International cooperation is encouraged in this topic. 
In this topic, the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and 
innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the 
research effort.

• Identify new, and analyse existing, capability gaps of security practitioners, that space 
technologies can bridge, demonstrating on the field innovative solutions based on 
EGNSS and possibly other EU Space Programme components such as Copernicus; 
• Create new space-based commercial opportunities for innovative businesses serving 
practitioner organisations.  
Scope: Proposals should be built on the exploitation of the distinguishing features of Galileo 
and EGNOS seeking to enhance the way practitioners prepare for and manage crises and 
security operations. Proposals should develop applications and technologies that focus on 
commercial exploitation in one of the following priority areas, which must be clearly 
indicated: 
• Development of EGNSS-based spoofing-proof downstream solutions to support the 
digital transformation of security practitioners in security-critical operations (e.g. Law 
Enforcement Agencies, Custom Authorities, Border and Coast Guards, etc) in various 
applications, including: environmental crimes management, prevention of smuggling and 
trafficking, counter-terrorism, border and maritime surveillance, migration management, 
fugitive search, public safety and fundamental rights, illegal poaching, customs 
operations 
and 
Electronic 
Freight 
Transport 
Information, 
dangerous 
goods 
transportation, usage of robots and/or automated Galileo-enabled platforms for 
surveillance, etc.; 
• Development of EGNSS-based downstream solutions to support the resiliency and 
functioning of critical infrastructures in EU (e.g. digital infrastructure, drinking water 
supply and distribution, water waste management, healthcare, e-government, etc.); 
• Development of EGNSS-based downstream solutions to support crisis management 
operations: drone-supported operations, improved and safer asset management systems, 
AR/VR for first responders, novel EGNSS smartphone-sized or wearable technologies, 
UneXploded Ordnance (UXO) risk assessment and clearance for humanitarian 
operations, etc.  
Proposals are also expected to address cybersecurity threats in the description of the 
solution(s). 
Proposals should, when relevant, integrate other data sources/services from other EU Space 
Programme components, in particular Copernicus and/or GOVSATCOM. Where appropriate, 
the beneficiaries are encouraged to interact with the relevant Entrusted Entities managing the 
Copernicus Emergency Management Service and/or the Copernicus Security Service. 
The action focuses on the development of close to market EGNSS downstream applications 
through the realisation of large-scale demonstration and implementation projects, with the 
participation of relevant crisis and/or security practitioners. 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025

Part 7 - Page 337 of 339 
Developed applications should have a clearly defined commercial potential and should 
respond to user needs. The solution(s) developed is/are expected to achieve TRL 7-9 by the 
end of the project. 
Proposals should deliver new innovative applications, identifying and addressing existing 
gaps, leveraging the existing relevant sectorial regulations and policies and exploring how the 
solutions implemented using space data and services can address these regulations and be 
commercialised. Proposals should also highlight the expected impact and define a clear 
market uptake strategy, presenting a credible post-project pathway to operations. The 
developed solutions may integrate other non-space technologies like IoT, big data, artificial 
intelligence, drones, 5G, augmented/mixed reality etc.
