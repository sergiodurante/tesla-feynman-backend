Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 9 of 313 
Introduction 
The overarching driver for this cluster is to accelerate the twin green and digital transitions 
and associated transformation of our economy, industry and society with a view to achieving 
climate neutrality in Europe by 2050, and to increase the competitiveness of the European 
economies. This encompasses the transition to greenhouse gas neutrality of the energy and 
mobility sectors by 2050 at the latest (as well as that of other sectors not covered by this 
cluster), while boosting their competitiveness, resilience, and utility for citizens and society. 
Europe has been at the forefront of climate science and is committed to keep delivering the 
knowledge for enabling efficient pathways and just transitions to climate neutrality. 
Activities of this work programme support the implementation of the Paris Agreement and the 
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals1. By putting research and innovation at the 
heart of our economy, the EU aims to create more jobs and improve the competitiveness of its 
industry. On this basis, activities of this work programme will support the European 
Commission’s Net-Zero Industry Act and Clean Industrial Deal, a more circular and resilient 
economy, as well as enhanced climate adaptation, preparedness and solidarity. This will 
finally contribute to sustaining our quality of life and strengthening European societies and 
their social and economic model. 
Cluster 5 supports the EU’s strategic objectives through activities included in this work 
programme and through the support of Institutional European Partnerships 2  which are 
implemented through dedicated structures. Although the latter activities are not included in 
this work programme, it is of great importance to maximise synergy and coherence between 
activities regardless of their implementation mode3. Cluster 5 contributes also to the Strategic 
Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) objectives and its domain-specific implementation plans. 
Activities in this work programme will contribute to all Key Strategic Orientations (KSOs) 
of the Strategic Plan4: 
• The green transition: Horizon Europe R&I activities must support Europe to become 
the world’s first climate-neutral continent by 2050 and to tackle biodiversity loss and 
pollution. At least 35% of Horizon Europe’s resources are committed to be spent on 
climate action and 10% for 2025-2027 on biodiversity action. 
 
1 
Activities in this cluster will contribute to multiple SDGs, with the most direct impact on SDG 7 
(Affordable and clean energy), SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable 
Cities and Communities), and SDG 13 (Climate Action). In addition, SDG 3 (Good health and well-
being), SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 8 (Decent work and economic growth), and SDG 12 
(Responsible production and consumption) will be positively impacted. 
2 
Clean Hydrogen, Transforming Europe's rail system, Integrated Air Traffic Management, Clean 
Aviation 
3 
Activities specifically targeting fuel cells and hydrogen are primarily supported through calls for 
proposals of the European Partnership on Clean Hydrogen. However, in justified cases and in line with 
topic descriptions, specific aspects of hydrogen and fuel cells can be supported outside of the Clean 
Hydrogen Partnership

• The digital transition: Research to support the digital transition is key to Europe’s 
competitiveness and open strategic autonomy, and to setting human-centred standards. It 
is also key to achieving the green transition. In 2021-2027, it is agreed to invest at least 
EUR 13 billion from Horizon Europe in core digital technologies. 
• A more resilient, competitive, inclusive and democratic Europe: Europe’s democratic 
values and principles need a strong foundation so they can be promoted globally. 
Horizon Europe research activities will help reinforce this foundation. This includes 
research on civil security, on a fair and environmentally friendly economic model, on 
health and wellbeing and on democratic participation.  
Open strategic autonomy and securing Europe’s capacity in developing and deploying 
critical technologies are overarching drivers that apply across all three key strategic 
orientations. 
To contribute to these programme-level KSOs, cluster 5 will deliver on six specific expected 
impacts. In this work programme, each expected impact has been transformed into a specific 
Destination (see table below). This Destination-based work programme structure follows a 
thematic centre-of-gravity approach. Activities can have a cross-cutting character and will, in 
practice, often contribute to multiple expected impacts. The specific contribution to the 
overall expected impacts is explained in the introductory text of each Destination.

According to the intervention logic of this work programme, Destination 1 fosters climate 
science and thus helps to identify effective and efficient pathways and responses to climate 
change. Destination 2 supports different cross-cutting technologies and solutions for climate, 
energy and mobility applications. Destination 3 and 4 focus mainly on energy issues – 
Destination 3 on making energy supply more sustainable, secure and competitive; Destination 
4 on reducing energy demand of buildings and industry and enabling their more active role in 
a smart energy system. Destination 5 and 6 improve the performance of transport modes and 
mobility solutions – Destination 5 increases the competitiveness and climate/environmental 
performance of different transport modes; Destination 6 advances mobility services and 
solutions at system level for passengers and goods. 
Horizon Europe is the EU’s research and innovation support programme in a system of 
European and national funding programmes that share similar policy objectives. Projects that 
have been awarded a grant under a Horizon Europe call have the possibility to also receive 
funding under other EU programmes, including relevant shared management funds. In this 
context, applicants should actively seek synergies with other R&I-relevant EU, national or 
regional programmes (such as European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)5, European 
Social Fund Plus (ESF+)6, Just Transition Fund7, LIFE8, Innovation Fund9, InvestEU10, 
European Defence Fund (EDF)11), where appropriate, as well as private funds or financial 
instruments. 
With a view to be more effective in achieving impact, proposals are expected to synergise 
with other relevant initiatives funded at EU level, including the Knowledge and Innovation 
Communities (KICs) of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT)12. The 
innovation ecosystems created and nurtured by the EIT KICs (e.g., EIT Climate-KIC, EIT 
InnoEnergy, EIT Raw Materials) can in particular contribute to building communities or 
platforms for coordination and support actions, by sharing knowledge or disseminating the 
exploitation of the project results. Where relevant, and without prejudice to the direct 
participation of the EIT KICs in the R&I activities under this cluster, proposals are 
encouraged to explore other forms and means of service provisions that are complementary to 
the activities of the EIT KICs. Collaboration with other innovation communities that can 
support the project implementation and impact is also encouraged. Any such cooperation 
should be based on adequate intellectual property management strategies.

Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 12 of 313 
Research has proven that Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) and stakeholders’ 
involvement including citizens and civil society in projects is pivotal to understanding the 
societal transformation, including shifts in governance and institutions, socio-political 
relations, socio-cultural factors and knowledge systems, required for just and sustainable 
transitions, as well as for effecting technological change. They are addressed in relevant 
topics across the six destinations of the Cluster 5 work programme. In addition, this work 
programme pilots the integration of a Societal Readiness approach through eight pilot topics 
and a Coordinating and Support Action (CSA) for monitoring and evaluation: HORIZON-
CL5-2026-01-D2-09). This approach is based on Responsible Research and Innovation 
processes, with a strong focus on interdisciplinarity and knowledge integration. The 
integration of a Societal Readiness approach into R&I processes aims to address different 
societal needs and concerns, thereby increasing the potential for societal uptake. 
Horizon Europe’s approach to international cooperation consist of multilateralism and 
purposeful openness, combined with targeted actions with key third-country partners. Actions 
focus on aligning national, European and global efforts and investments in research and 
innovation areas that contribute to achieving key EU priorities. With regard to Cluster 5, the 
Commission pushes the acceleration of clean energy innovation through the Mission 
Innovation13 Initiative, which was launched at COP21 and currently comprises 24 countries 
and the European Commission. International cooperation of EU Member States and 
Associated Countries in the context of Mission Innovation in relevant topics in this work 
programme is encouraged. In addition, this work programme specifically addresses 
cooperation with African countries and cooperation on sustainable decarbonisation with major 
emitting countries around the world, in line with the spirit of the Paris Agreement which 
emphasises the need for global cooperation on technology development and transfer. Legal 
entities established in China are not eligible to participate in Innovation Actions in any 
capacity. Please refer to the Annex B of the General Annexes of this Work Programme for 
further details. 
Applicants to calls in this Work Programme are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the 
services offered by the EU-funded European Research Infrastructures, notably those 
prioritised by the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI)14, European 
Research Infrastructure Consortia (ERICs)15 and the European Open Science Cloud. 
For topics in this cluster, consortia should consider their voluntary contribution in terms of 
data, indicators, and knowledge to relevant Joint Research Centre (JRC) platforms for 
capitalising the knowledge developed in their projects and become more policy relevant16:

Instructions for Societal Readiness pilot projects: 
Understanding and responding to the needs and concerns of societal actors continues to be a 
priority for European Commission funded research18. In Cluster 5 work programme 2025, a 
Societal Readiness approach is being proposed to deepen relationships between R&I and

society. A number of topics19 within the Work Programme 2025 have been selected as a 
vanguard for advancing Societal Readiness practices. To support this work, the Commission 
has setup a common methodology for applicants. The outcomes of this Cluster 5 pilot in 
Societal Readiness will be closely assessed and analysed through a dedicated Coordination 
and Support Action HORIZON-CL5-2026-01-D2-09: Monitoring and Evaluation of the 
Societal Readiness Pilot. 
The Societal Readiness approach aims, when integrated into R&I processes, to improve the 
consideration of different societal needs and concerns and to respond to them, thereby 
increasing the potential for societal uptake. To achieve this, all types of project partners – 
including Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and Social Sciences 
and Humanities (SSH) profiles – should be engaged and interact effectively and in sustained 
ways. Inclusive participation early in proposal development and throughout the project will 
enable an interdisciplinary approach serving the objectives of the topic. 
Definitions related to this Societal Readiness pilot follow those instructions. 
Proposals submitted for topics that request to follow the Societal Readiness approach are 
expected to meet all the requirements listed below: 
• Resources should be explicitly allocated to cover project activities associated with 
advancing Societal Readiness. Societal Readiness considerations should be integrated 
transversally in the proposal, either as a set of tasks across work packages associated 
with the R&I work, or in the form of a transversal work package. 
• Consortia should bring sufficient expertise to support Societal Readiness activities via 
the inclusion of partners with appropriate expertise in SSH disciplines20. These partners 
will facilitate the socio-technical interface and enable the design of project objectives, 
work packages and tasks compatible with Societal Readiness related activities. 
• All partners in the consortia should be associated to the Societal Readiness tasks, where 
relevant, building on interdisciplinarity efforts to facilitate knowledge integration. 
• Proposals should clearly address, under section 1.2 Methodology, how the project will 
integrate Societal Readiness throughout the proposed work, by demonstrating how they 
take up the Societal Readiness guiding questions relevant to the subject (see section 
below). 
• Proposals should allocate reasonable resources as part of a dedicated task to engage with 
the Coordinating and Support Action funded under HORIZON-CL5-2026-01-D2-09 
(e.g., participation in physical format to annual workshops, availability to reply to 
 
19 
HORIZON-CL5-2025-03-D1-06; HORIZON-CL5-2025-02-D3-04; HORIZON-CL5-2026-02-D4-02;

HORIZON-CL5-2025-04-D6-11; HORIZON-CL5-2025-04-D6-12 
20 
For example, profiles with experience in addressing social and cultural perspectives, methodological 
knowledge to e.g., conduct and analyse interviews, design, and lead co-creation, facilitate inclusion, or 
otherwise meaningfully support the consideration of and responsiveness to societal needs and concerns.

interviews, punctual exchanges with other Societal Readiness pilot projects, provide 
access to Societal Readiness related information). Travel costs to attend physical 
workshops will be covered by topic HORIZON-CL5-2026-01-D2-09. 
• A public report called First report on Societal Readiness should be delivered within the 
first six months of the project. The report will build on the Societal Readiness approach 
for the project as set out in the proposal. It should primarily focus on the project’s vision 
for and approach to Societal Readiness; reflections on initial impressions of societal 
needs and concerns as connected to the project; preliminary responses to the guiding 
questions; more detailed plans on how Societal Readiness will be addressed (e.g., time 
plans, roles and responsibilities, relation to tasks/work packages, anticipated results and 
how these will be integrated into the project activities). 
• A public report called Final report on Societal Readiness should be delivered within the 
last three months of the project. The report will reflect upon the project’s experience 
with implementing Societal Readiness approaches; any differences in experience 
between expected and actual outcomes; challenges and lessons learned from successful 
or unsuccessful efforts; ways in which different societal actors were identified and 
engaged in interdisciplinary or intersectoral activities, as well as these actors needs and 
concerns considered, identified, and responded to; and recommendations for future 
projects on similar thematic areas. The Final report on Societal Readiness is expected to 
directly address the questions identified in the First report on Societal Readiness.  
The standard template of the Application Form remains unchanged, and its page limit is 
increase by two additional pages. The proposed work is expected to reflect an integration of 
Societal Readiness consideration into the overall project design. 
Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) guiding questions:  
The following guiding questions21 are offered to support project teams in considering and 
integrating a Societal Readiness approach in proposals and, subsequently, in projects’ 
implementation. Consideration of questions in the proposal stage helps to ensure a consortium 
is well positioned to advance Societal Readiness during project implementation. This 
consideration includes reflecting upon the four dimensions of Responsible Research and 
Innovation (RRI) namely reflection, inclusion, anticipation, and responsiveness, as indicated 
next to each question (see complete definition of RRI in the Horizon Europe Programme 
 
21 
The questions that follow are condensed from and based on the Societal Readiness Thinking Tool 
elaborated within the EU-funded project NewHoRRIzon, and subsequently detailed in Bernstein, M. J., 
Nielsen, M. W., Alnor, E., Brasil, A., Birkving, A. L., Chan, T. T., Griessler, E., de Jong, S., van de

Guide22). The following guiding questions are offered as a basis for reflection and may be 
complemented by other considerations specific to the topic’s subject. 
• R&I Goals: How do the objectives and expected results of the proposal reflect and 
integrate the diverse societal needs or goals of different social groups potentially 
involved or affected? (RRI dimensions: reflection, inclusion, responsiveness) 
• Societal actors: How does the proposal identify and include key stakeholder groups in 
activities? If appropriate, how does the proposal identify and include groups often 
marginalised or excluded from previous or similar initiatives? (RRI dimensions: 
reflection, inclusion) 
• Benefits and burdens: Who stands to benefit from envisioned activities of the project and 
their expected impacts? Who stands to bear the burdens (social, environmental, 
economic or other)? How are the groups bearing these burdens included in and given a 
voice in the project? How are possible conflicts of interest and uncertainties managed? 
(RRI dimensions: anticipation, reflection, responsiveness) 
• Objections and concerns: How does the project, through its activities, plan to identify 
and respond to the objections or concerns of different groups of societal actors? How 
could potential undesired consequences of activities, results, outcomes, or impacts be 
anticipated? How could such consequences be avoided? (RRI dimensions: reflection, 
inclusion, anticipation, responsiveness)  
Evaluation of the Societal Readiness aspect:  
Societal Readiness will be assessed in the same way as other aspects that belong to 
‘Methodology’ within the Excellence section of the Application form. During the evaluation, 
all comments under the “Excellence” criterion will be consolidated so that a mark out of five 
points is issued, which reflects the overall score of the proposal for the “Excellence” 
evaluation criterion. 
Definitions related to Societal Readiness considerations in Horizon Europe proposals 
and projects 
1. Societal Readiness 
Societal Readiness 23 is an indicator of R&I results, expressing they have accounted for 
different societal needs and concerns, thereby increasing its potential for societal uptake and 
transition towards societal adaptation. 
R&I results with well-developed Societal Readiness will: 
• better align innovation trajectories with societally desired and needed goals;

Part 8 - Page 17 of 313 
• build inclusive and multi-stakeholder coalitions for change; 
• understand diverse apprehensions and interests; and 
• adapt to overcome undesired aspects of the proposed innovation.  
Working toward Societal Readiness means to better understand that R&I should be: 
• driven by the needs, values, and expectations of diverse social groups (e.g., gender, age, 
socio-economic situation, geography, vulnerable persons24, etc.); 
• inclusive and transparent in processes and outcomes; 
• active in identifying, mitigating, and avoiding negative/providing positive social, 
environmental, and economic externalities.  
Societal Readiness will contribute to more impactful R&I by widening the focus of 
researchers and innovators from the very beginning or in the course of an innovation effort to 
address broader, long-term societal concerns. It will therefore support achieving European 
Commission policy objectives and help achieving the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals25. 
2. Responsible Research & Innovation (RRI) 
To deliver R&I results with well-developed Societal Readiness, the four dimensions of 
Responsible Research & Innovation offer a helpful starting point: 
Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI), as a concept introduced in R&I policy and 
previous European Commission framework programmes, primarily focuses on processes of 
R&I. In the context of care for the future, RRI offers a set of procedural interventions in 
policy makers’ and researchers’ activities by supporting co-creation with societal actors in 
different ways. Specifically, RRI asks for four dimensions to be practiced in research26,27: 
• Reflection on the goals, values, and activities of R&I: Reflection is about reasoning on 
the underlying motivations, assumptions, and commitments driving the R&I work. 
• Inclusion of broader, diverse groups of stakeholders and participants: Inclusion is 
closely related to public engagement and stakeholder involvement. It is about involving 
relevant societal actors in R&I activities from an early stage, and ensuring continuous, 
open dialogue about desirable outcomes throughout the project.

• Anticipation of possible consequences, knock-on effects, unintended consequences of 
R&I: Anticipation is about carefully examining both the intended and possible 
unintended consequences arising from R&I activities, including environmental, health-
related, economic, and social impacts. 
• Responsiveness to recommendations and changes to improve R&I processes in the 
service of improved public impact: Responsiveness is about aligning R&I activities with 
the new perspectives, insights, awareness, and values that emerge in the process of being 
more anticipatory, reflexive, and inclusive in R&I processes. It presupposes a will to 
learn from practical experience and a capacity to translate this learning into responsible 
R&I solutions.  
These four dimensions inform the guiding questions provided in support of developing 
proposals and implementing projects aiming to reach a well-developed Societal Readiness. 
3. Integration of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH)28 
To achieve a well-developed Societal Readiness of R&I results, social and cultural 
perspectives need to be covered. This may be done by researchers from Social Science and 
Humanities (SSH) disciplines29 , as those disciplines have developed a wide range of theories 
and methods to better understand human behaviour and social organisation. 
Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) study aspects of human society:30 
• SSH encompass a wide range of disciplines such as sociology and economics, 
psychology and political science, history and cultural sciences, law, and ethics. 
Contributions from these research fields are needed to generate new knowledge, support 
evidence-based policymaking, develop key competences and produce interdisciplinary 
solutions to both societal and technological issues31. 
• Social science is the study of people: as individuals, communities, and societies; their 
behaviours and interactions with each other and with their built, technological, and 
natural environments. Social science seeks to understand the evolving human systems 
across our increasingly complex world and how our planet can be more sustainably 
managed. […] Social science includes many different areas of study, such as how people 
organise and govern themselves, and broker power and international relations; how 
wealth is generated, economies develop, and economic futures are modelled; how 
 
28 
SSH disciplines are relevant to R&I in Cluster 5, since they help to investigate the societal aspects of 
climate, energy and mobility challenges and opportunities. They have been integrated and 
mainstreamed in Horizon Europe Cluster 5 topics since the start of the Horizon 2020 Framework 
Programme

business works and what a sustainable future means; the ways in which populations are 
changing, and issues of unemployment, deprivation and inequality; and how these social, 
cultural and economic dynamics vary in different places, with different outcomes32. 
• Humanities (e.g., disciplines like History, Arts, Philosophy, Theology) are concerned 
with fundamental, and sometimes unspoken, principles that underpin human cultures, 
how people reason, how societies are ordered and governed, and how people and 
societies grapple with issues like responsibility, representation and participation, 
(in)equality, equity, ethics, faith, and so on, sometimes with attention to constructions of 
meanings of ‘good’, ‘bad’, ‘desirable’, ‘justice’ etc. (even if indirectly).  
Integrating theories, methods, and principles across the full range of SSH is highly relevant 
for effective interdisciplinary R&I pursuing Societal Readiness.

Destinations 
Climate sciences and responses for the transformation towards climate neutrality 
This Destination contributes directly to the Strategic Plan’s Key Strategic Orientations 
‘Green transition’, ‘Digital transition’ and ‘A more resilient, competitive, inclusive and 
democratic Europe’. 
In line with the Strategic Plan, the overall expected impact of this Destination is to contribute 
to the “Advancing science for a transition to a climate-neutral and resilient society”. 
Advancing climate science and the knowledge base necessary to underpin actionable solutions 
is essential for catalysing the global transition to a climate-neutral and climate-resilient 
society. Evidence on research gaps of high policy relevance can be found in the European 
Climate Risk Assessment (EUCRA)49, and in the report “The Next frontier for Climate 
Change Science”50. 
Research should contribute to closing major knowledge gaps on the changing climate together 
with their associated impacts and risks, on both society and nature, and to developing tools to 
support decision-makers in designing and implementing effective mitigation and adaptation 
actions at various time and spatial scales while properly accounting for synergies and trade-
offs with other policy objectives, such as biodiversity, industrial competitiveness, just 
transition and leaving no one behind. Notably, state-of-art scientific evidence will be 
increasingly vital to guide policy decisions aimed at safeguarding long-term societal welfare 
and EU’s economic resilience as climate change impacts increase. Tailored scientific 
approaches that take into account disparities between regions, countries, communities and 
diverse groups within society, are needed, to understand how they are affected by global 
warming and what array of response options is available to them. 
The first objective is to support and accelerate climate action (both mitigation and 
adaptation) globally by: 
• Improved knowledge of the Earth system, its recent evolution and future responses under 
different global emissions pathways and socio-economic scenarios; 
• Increased understanding of the interrelated impacts between climate change, human and 
natural systems, including from compound, cascading and tail risks, improving the 
attribution to anthropogenic factors, and leveraging the role of climate services for 
effective adaptation and response strategies; 
• Well-designed and evaluated solutions and pathways for climate-resilient, low-
greenhouse- gas-emission development enabling just societal transformation while

promoting citizen and stakeholder involvement, climate literacy and integration of 
natural and social sciences; 
• Increased synergies with the EU Mission on Adaptation to Climate Change, by 
generating actionable knowledge in support of transformative adaptation.  
The second objective contributes substantially to key international assessments by closing key 
knowledge gaps related to climate change. Such assessments include the ones by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Intergovernmental Science-Policy 
Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the Scientific Assessment of 
Ozone Depletion and initiatives such as the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) 
and the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) under the World 
Climate Research Programme (WCRP). 
The third objective is a strengthened European Research Area on climate change by 
boosting scientific excellence and capacity in an inclusive manner across the participating 
countries. 
The fourth objective is the maximisation of synergies with other policy priorities such as 
biodiversity and ecosystem preservation and restoration, just transition, just resilience, 
pollution reduction, health and well-being, resource conservation, circularity, and the 
Sustainable Development Goals by exploring co-benefits, trade-offs and potential unintended 
consequences of climate strategies and policy interventions. 
Strong links exist with activities funded under Cluster 6 on climate-ocean-polar-cryosphere 
nexus, and in Cluster 3 on disaster risk reduction, and with the Mission on Adaptation to 
Climate Change. The results of research funded under this Destination, in particular those 
informing the design of effective mitigation and adaptation pathways, are also highly relevant 
for other EU Missions on Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities, on Soil, and on Ocean and 
Water.

access and utilise in a timely manner scientifically robust climate projections 
corresponding to a range of future scenarios and their corresponding greenhouse gas 
emission pathways, including scenarios matching the Paris Agreement targets; 
• Decision makers and society can better understand the impacts, risks and implications of 
pathways involving different magnitudes and durations of temperature overshoot; 
• The European research community provides a coordinated contribution to the IPCC and 
other major scientific initiatives (e.g., IPBES, WCRP, World Adaptation Science 
Programme (WASP), the Global Carbon Budget), in support of informing the UNFCCC 
process and other global, European and national climate efforts;

Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) are better coordinated between each 
other, with outcomes more consistent and responding to policy needs better and in a 
timelier manner; 
• The European contribution to these programmes is supported by an improved and 
interconnected overarching infrastructure.  
Scope: Given the rapidly developing climate crisis, there is an increasing need for accurate, 
reliable, and actionable information at global to local spatial scales, and near to long 
timescales. This information supports a range of requirements, including policy related ones. 
In particular, simulations and knowledge delivered that feed into the IPCC, including the 
Seventh Assessment Report (AR7) and later ones, should be internally coherent and well-
coordinated. The modelling, setting, ensemble, and simulation design should be suited to meet 
societal and policy demands to support timelier European and international climate policy 
developments. This also implies progressing towards an operational framework to provide the 
best possible information for societal decision-making that brings together available 
approaches. The resulting simulations and analysis should sample the full spectrum of climate 
risks. In particular, as global mitigation efforts are presently insufficient and temperatures 
continue to rise, the impacts of global warming overshoot on the Earth system and the 
feasibility, possible pace, and implications of bringing global temperatures down in a 
sustainable way after an overshoot need to be explored. This analysis should also consider the 
risks and consequences of potential abrupt and irreversible impacts (e.g., sea level rise, 
changes in ocean circulation, ocean-acidification, water cycle alterations, soil alterations, 
aridification, species extinctions, loss of sea ice, glaciers, and ice sheets, and crossing climate 
and ecological tipping points). 
Therefore, actions should address all of the following aspects: 
• Generate future global climate projections with state-of-the-art Earth System Models 
(ESM) which are built on the latest improvements in modelling technologies and in 
process understanding with a more complete representation of climate–carbon cycle 
feedback; 
• Design climate simulations considering the socio-economic scenarios from the most up 
to date set of Integrated Assessment Models (IAM). Greenhouse gas emission pathways 
should be provided based on various societal mitigation and adaptation choices and land-
use scenarios. Climate feedback should be also considered. The resulting assessment 
should link allowable carbon emissions with key climate targets, spanning policy 
relevant temporal and spatial scales; 
• Deliver scenarios and simulations with different levels and durations of warming 
overshoot (to be selected for their policy relevance), assessing the corresponding risks 
accounting for fast and slow onset processes and the feasibility and limits of carbon 
dioxide removal methodologies; 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 42 of 313 
• Update and coordinate the assumptions as well as the observational and simulated 
climate data sets underpinning the models and experiments of the various climate 
science communities (including Earth system, sectoral impacts, adaptation, and 
mitigation modellers) across international programmes, such as IAMC, CMIP, 
CORDEX and ISIMIP, optimising the interaction between them as much as possible 
within the same IPCC cycle; 
• Design a framework to coordinate and incorporate the suite of global and regional 
climate projections, encompassing the range of available model resolutions and model 
realism, using consistent concentration and emission-driven ESMs, enhancing 
collaboration between European Earth system modelling and service provision, such as 
Copernicus and Destination Earth. This system should include cross-analysis and 
evaluation of the full suite of models, including approaches for sampling projection and 
scenario uncertainty (e.g., emulators). The framework should also make the modelling 
results more accessible and understandable to the practitioners and decision makers; 
• Improve the existing infrastructure landscape (software, tools, data, adaptation of models 
to High-Performance Computing (HPC)), to support the delivery of global and regional 
climate projections and associated analysis (for which a part of the budget may be 
allocated, but not more than 30% of the total eligible costs). This should be 
complementary to efforts funded through the European Research Infrastructures, Euro-
HPC Joint Undertaking, Digital Europe Programme and other sources. ESM simulations 
are intended as the core of the topic with links to other modelling activities. To maximise 
the policy relevance of the climate simulations delivered, the operationalisation 
framework and the scenarios should be developed in co-creation with policy makers 
(e.g., through advisory boards or other participatory procedures).  
When dealing with models, actions should promote the highest standards of transparency and 
openness, as much as possible going well beyond documentation and extending to aspects 
such as assumptions, protocols, code, and data that is managed in compliance with the FAIR 
principles53. 
They should envisage clustering activities with any other relevant projects (in54 and outside of 
Horizon Europe) for cross-projects cooperation and exchange of results. Proposals should 
earmark the necessary resources for these purposes. As this endeavour should be supported by 
the research communities that continuously improve the modelling systems and related 
infrastructure, strong interaction and coordination is expected with the projects funded under 
previous calls of this Destination and other relevant projects on ESM, with the topic 
HORIZON-CL5-2025-03-D1-02 “Advancing Earth System Models to increase understanding 
of Earth system change”, and with the topic HORIZON-INFRA-2025-01-SERV-02 (area on

under the action. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Advanced understanding and capability to predict the future evolution of the Earth 
system, at global to local spatial scales and from weather to climate timescales, including 
the socio-economic and environmental impacts of these changes; 
• Advanced understanding and capability to predict regional climate variability, including 
extreme events and regional water cycle, in particular, regional precipitation; 
• Strengthened collaboration and cross-fertilisation across available approaches to Earth 
system and climate modelling science, enabling a joint contribution to the next 
generation of Earth system models (ESMs); 
• Long-term science, modelling and evidence base to support European and international 
polices are advanced.   
Scope: ESMs are the primary tools used for assessing future changes in the climate system. 
They have increased in their resolution and realism over the past two decades. Despite these 
advances, there remain several poorly understood and simulated processes, interactions and 
feedbacks that limit their ability to deliver accurate predictions and projections of global and 
regional Earth system change, and to aid understanding and quantifying future climate 
variability. Specially challenging is how variability interacts with extreme events (including 
compound ones), in particular related to precipitation and water availability (both excess and 
scarcity). 
Actions should address all of the following aspects:   
1. Improving the simulation of the coupled Earth system and its sensitivity to natural and 
anthropogenic forcings, with a better representation of key Earth system and climate 
feedbacks and processes, including, among others, one or more of the following 
advances57:        
 The interplay between global change, regional climate variability, and changes in 
climate and weather extremes;    
 Terrestrial-ocean-climate interactions;    
 Coupled climate-carbon-water cycle feedbacks;    
 Coupled climate-ocean-ice interactions;    
 Aerosol-cloud-climate forcing and feedback;    
 
57 
The evaluation will be based on the standard Horizon Europe evaluation criteria, regardless of the 
number of the aspects covered. 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 45 of 313 
 Climate-vegetation-fire interactions;    
 Climate-air quality interactions;    
 Interactions between land use scenarios (in terms of changes in the land use and 
surface, such as those related to carbon dioxide removal, with consequences on the 
water and carbon cycles, albedo and aerosols) and regional climate.   
2. Increased collaboration across different model development approaches encompassing 
the range of available model resolutions and model realism. 
3. Bring together and further improve existing and new observational and reanalysis 
datasets, models, emulators, and analysis tools to facilitate rapid and in-depth bias 
identification, model calibration and validation, and evaluation and understanding of 
model simulations.  
Actions should exploit the opportunities offered by state of art digital technologies such as 
machine learning, big data analytics or Artificial Intelligence (AI). They should promote the 
highest standards of transparency and openness, extending to aspects such as assumptions, 
protocols, code, and data that is managed in compliance with the FAIR principles 58 . 
Beneficiaries of EU funding are required to publish results data in open access repositories 
and/or as annexes to publications, and provide full openness of any new modules, models or 
tools developed from scratch or substantially improved. Projects should take into account, 
during their lifetime, relevant activities and initiatives for ensuring and improving the quality 
of scientific software and code. 
All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to connect, coordinate, and 
participate in networking, intercomparison and joint activities to exploit synergies and 
maximise complementarities between them. They should envisage clustering activities with 
any other relevant projects (in59 and outside of Horizon Europe) for cross-projects cooperation 
and exchange of results. Proposals should earmark the necessary resources for these purposes. 
Results from relevant past and ongoing projects from previous calls of this Destination and 
other relevant projects on ESM should be considered and strong feedback and coordination 
with projects funded under the topics HORIZON-CL5-2025-06-D1-01 “Climate simulations

Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer

inform them on policy options for an ambitious implementation of the Kigali 
Agreement63, including a transition to natural refrigerants, and how this interacts with 
the decarbonisation of the energy system.  
Scope: F-gases are the fastest growing group of greenhouse gas emissions globally. The 
Montreal Protocol resulted in decreasing use and emissions of Ozone Depleting Substances 
and will now also regulate a phasedown of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), representing the 
largest share of F-gas use, of which the majority is used in refrigeration, air conditioning and 
heat pump equipment. 
The project should improve the knowledge base of F-gas use and emission pathways under 
baseline conditions (i.e., policies as they are today), pathways that meet the Kigali Agreement 
and pathways that outperform the Kigali Agreement. The development of these pathways 
should also include fluorinated greenhouse gases not regulated under the Montreal Protocol, 
in particular those covered by the Regulation (EU) 2024/573 on fluorinated greenhouse 
gases64. It should cover all main regions globally separating at least the countries that fall 
under Article 5 of the Montreal Protocol and those that do not, and preferably further 
disaggregating them within these two classes, taking into account for instance climate 
conditions. The development should assess the interaction with the energy system, notably 
related to the deployment of HFC-alternatives in refrigeration, air conditioning and heat pump 
equipment and its impact on energy efficiency, the deployment of sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) 
or its alternatives in electrical switch-gear. Possible impacts on emissions of per- and 
polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) should be considered. The pathways should give detailed 
insights into the technologies available, including the use of F-gases-free alternatives. 
Most F-gas emissions are related to the use in the refrigeration, air conditioning and heat 
pump (RACHP) equipment. This sector is projected to be one of the highest contributors to 
future global energy demand increases. The action should include the development of 
modelling tools that allow for the representation at national level of the use of F-gases and 
their alternatives at least in this RACHP sector, with a view to develop tools that would allow 
parties to the Montreal Protocol to assess at national level different options of mitigating HFC 
use, and the interaction with the decarbonisation of the energy system. The action should thus 
expand and improve the number of tools that can provide such detailed information at country 
level, including for the so called Article 5 Parties under the Montreal Protocol, in a manner 
that would improve the knowledge base for parties to implement specifically the Kigali 
Agreement to the Montreal Protocol as well as allow them to get insights in how to create 
synergies with the climate mitigation goals of the Paris Agreement, including the 
decarbonisation of the energy system.

Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Advanced understanding of the causality between anthropogenic climate change and the 
frequency and intensity of climate and weather extremes (including temperature 
extremes, heavy precipitation and pluvial floods, river floods, droughts, storms, as well 
as compound events), and their risks and impacts, including cascading impacts, on 
human systems and ecosystems; 
• Improved methodologies and tools of attribution of extreme climate- and weather-related 
events, and their impacts, to anthropogenic climate change; 
• Enhancement of existing or creation of new pilot global databases of extreme events, 
impacts and their attribution; 
• Advanced knowledge of how attribution science and forecasting can be operationalised 
for a range of policy purposes, including informing and improving preparedness, civil 
protection and humanitarian planning for future extreme and slow-onset events, post-
disaster reconstruction, resilience and adaptation plans.  
Scope: Anthropogenic climate change influences the intensity and likelihood of extreme 
weather events – the latest IPCC report warns that anthropogenic climate is already affecting 
weather and climate extremes across the globe and with every additional increment of global 
warming, changes in extremes will continue to become larger. 
Attribution science tries to answer the question of what the role of anthropogenic climate 
change relative to other drivers (natural and non-climate anthropogenic factors), is for a given 
extreme climate or weather event. It is relatively nascent, and while it is fast advancing, 
numerous gaps remain, including on compound and cascading events, the interplay between 
slow and fast onset events, the appropriate statistical methods and the proper consideration of 
various degrees of vulnerabilities and exposure. 
Some tail events, risks and associated impacts are inherently poorly represented in current 
simulation records. The latest advances in numerical modelling, AI and Machine Learning, 
counter-factual datasets using large ensembles and digital twins, for example, could increase 
the sample size of simulated rare – including compound and cascading - events and offer 
opportunities to explore the decision-making and estimated impact space (e.g., in relation to 
water, air pollution, ecosystem status, land use – and their combination). Propagating 
uncertainties along the causality chain is an important aspect to address in this context. 
Actions should address all of the following aspects: 
• Advance attribution science through a combination of observations, models, attribution 
methodologies applied to the physical climate conditions (fast and slow-onset event 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 50 of 313 
attribution for a more accurate estimation of how the likelihood and intensity of the 
hazards have been altered by anthropogenic climate change) and impacts (identifying 
how the interplay between anthropogenic climate change and local implemented 
responses affects residual impacts); 
• Advance the understanding of the interplay between natural variability and 
anthropogenic climate change both in the recent past (since the instrumental data is 
available) and in the near- and mid- term future (2025-2060), as well as the interplay 
between climate and non-climate drivers of impacts, and socially differentiated 
vulnerability patterns; 
• Advance methodologies to collect diverse in-situ and remote sensing observations to 
develop or contribute to robust extreme event and impact databases; 
• In the context of attribution, focus on extreme and slow-onset events and their 
interactions (including cascading and compound events) and impacts (on human systems 
and ecosystems), locally implemented responses and their limits (response capacities), 
with due consideration of vulnerable regions; 
• Deliver enhanced methods to separate the effects of climate trends (including in extreme 
events) from trends in exposure and vulnerability, both in observed datasets and in 
model scenarios; 
• Investigate how different model enhancements (e.g., finer resolution, increased 
complexity) impact the realism and accuracy of the modelled climate and weather 
extremes. Strive to investigate inter-model differences and their implications for extreme 
event attribution and contribute to multi-model and intercomparison approaches (e.g., 
Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project, ISIMIP), including with 
downscaling and bias correction of global models for better simulation of extreme 
events; 
• Building on latest advances in attribution studies, improve forecasting of extreme 
climate- and weather-related events and their impacts, and contribute to the evolution of 
climate services; 
• Improve the knowledge of how to operationalise the attribution science and forecasting 
for informing future planning including in some of the areas relevant for advancing 
disaster preparedness and prevention capacity building, humanitarian aid operations, and 
adaptation plans (e.g., early warning systems, disaster risk reduction including with 
nature-based solutions, emergency relief) via co-design and co-production with 
operational actors, including citizens and civil society globally and with due 
consideration of associated challenges in the Global South; 
• The results should serve as a basis to ensure policies and actions that follow from the 
attribution studies can integrate climate justice.

Grants awarded under this topic will be linked between them by means 
of a collaboration agreement and will have to submit the following 
deliverables: (i) A joint action plan (between months 6 and 12), 
produced in collaboration between the projects funded under this topic; 
and (ii) A common part of the methodology (not later than month 24), 
produced and agreed by the projects funded under this topic. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Adaptation communities - from researchers to practitioners, citizens and decision makers 
- have an improved understanding of the factors driving climate change adaptation 
limits71 and effectiveness72; 
• Policy makers can select and prioritise adaptation strategies to design adaptation policies 
from improved and more consistent comparability of adaptation options and outcomes; 
• The limits and effectiveness of adaptation strategies are evaluated by a comprehensive, 
multidimensional set of criteria within a standardised methodology, thus contributing to 
the work of the IPCC. A scientific contribution for updating the 1994 IPCC Technical 
Guidelines on impacts and adaptation is provided; 
• Practitioners and decision makers at all relevant levels of governance (local, national, 
regional, and European) are provided with a consistent framework and tools for 
monitoring, evaluation, and adjustment of their adaptation strategies, both in the short 
term (for more effective disaster prevention and preparedness) and in the long term (for 
more effective transformative and climate resilient adaptation pathways).   
Scope: The effectiveness of climate change adaptation measures depends, among other 
factors, on the magnitude and rate of warming, which can lead to context-specific hard limits 
being encountered. However, the scientific evidence related to adaptation effectiveness 
remains limited, and providing a universal definition of what constitutes effective adaptation 
is challenging. This is motivated by difficulties in defining baseline conditions given the 
dynamic nature of the adaptation, in measuring avoided impacts and in establishing causality. 
Other problems arise from the long lead time until responses show outcomes, and limited 
 
71 
Adaptation limits: The point at which an actor’s objectives (or system needs) cannot be secured from 
intolerable risks through adaptive actions. Hard adaptation limit – No adaptive actions are possible to 
avoid intolerable risks. Soft adaptation limit – Options may exist but are currently not available to avoid 
intolerable risks through adaptive action. 
72 
Effectiveness: refers to the extent to which an action reduces vulnerability and climate-related risk, 
increases resilience, and avoids maladaptation (IPCC, 2022). 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 53 of 313 
understanding of trade-offs across spatial scales, community systems and sectors, which limits 
the application of a system approach, essential for this analysis. Ex-ante and ex-post 
monitoring and evaluation of adaptation at different timelines and scales is also critical but 
currently scarcely implemented. It is urgent to better understand and assess adaptation 
effectiveness and limits to increase adaptive capacity, resilience against extreme, and slow 
onset, non-extreme events, and to reduce vulnerability and exposure. 
The actions should generate assessments of the effectiveness and limits of adaptation options 
based on quantitative and qualitative evidence (privileging scientific literature but 
systematically integrating insights from grey literature and including diverse group’s 
perspectives and knowledge), methodologically sound (replicable and with new metrics and 
indicators informed with uncertainty) and comprehensive in the criteria considered (such as 
economic, technological, legal, institutional, socio-cultural, geophysical, environmental and 
cross-cutting aspects that determine soft limits). Cross-cutting criteria to be included are the 
contribution of the adaptation solutions to mitigation, their ability to reduce cascading, 
compound effects and risks transmission, the degree of use of nature-based solutions (NBS), 
together with the feasibility, the ambition level, and their contribution to equity and justice. 
Other relevant aspects that should be considered are the exogenous factors, the gender, age 
and intersectional dimensions, the governance and the barriers and enablers. 
Actions should evaluate adaptation effectiveness and limits as a function of time and for a 
comprehensive range of warming rates, considering the changing variability patterns. Projects 
should address all of the following aspects: 
• Further the understanding of the general and context specific (e.g., regional, sectoral, 
etc.) drivers of adaptation effectiveness and limits, including vulnerability; 
• Develop a robust methodology to assess the effectiveness and limits of adaptation 
options in a consistent way, assuring comparability among assessments. Such a 
methodology should:        
 Synthesise different sources of observational (both quantitative and qualitative 
evidence) and modelling data that are relevant at the regional, local or sectoral 
levels to assess multiple dimensions of effectiveness and adaptation limits over 
time;     
 Have sufficient common core elements to ensure consistency and comparability 
among regions and sectors, and sufficient flexibility to reflect their contextual 
specificities;     
 Include a comprehensive set of measurements and indicators and approaches to 
characterise adaptation as a process and assess quantitatively and qualitatively the 
multiple dimensions and aspects of adaptation effectiveness and limits (both hard 
and soft);     

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 54 of 313 
 Explore the optimal balance between standardisation and the context specific 
elements of the methodology.    
• Test and apply the methodology for the following purposes:        
 To evaluate the effectiveness of advanced and short-term planned adaptation 
strategies, for a variety of European (EU Member States and Horizon Europe 
Associated Countries) environmental and socio-economic sectors, conditions or 
regions (a minimum of 6 study cases is recommended). Collaboration with the EU 
Mission on Adaptation to Climate Change is strongly encouraged, for example, in 
the test cases;     
 To inform the timeline and likelihood of emergence of context-specific (i.e., 
regions and sectors) limits to adaptation in a warming world, with an emphasis on 
societal, climate and biodiversity hotspots.    
• Synthesising the results as usable knowledge for practitioners and decision makers and 
communicating and disseminating them using existing platforms (e.g., expanding the 
Climate-ADAPT platform of the European Environment Agency or other options).   
While joint work will not occur at proposal stage, the common core of the methodology 
should be jointly developed by all the projects funded under this topic by combining their 
respective proposal’s approaches, to ensure overall consistency. For assuring this, proposals 
should include a draft plan for joint actions, to be then adapted and agreed between all funded 
projects. Therefore, all proposals must include a deliverable preferably for month 6 (not later 
than month 12) that contains the agreed joint action plan. Proposals should dedicate specific 
tasks and resources, setting aside an adequate budget (in the range of 15 to 25% of their total 
eligible budget) to collaborate with other projects funded under this topic on developing the 
common core of the methodology. As a result, this core part should be also a joint deliverable 
for not later than month 24. Then, the methodology should be separately extended by 
individual projects to address EU regional and sectoral contexts (e.g., by specific modules) 
maintaining consistency with the core part. It should build on existing data and approaches, 
such as those proposed by Copernicus, GAMI73, EUCRA74, WASP75 and other relevant 
sources. Aspects such as sectorial and geographical coverage of the real-world case studies 
are left to the proposals to decide, provided they demonstrate a wide variety of existing or 
new adaptation options in Europe. 
Actions should promote the highest standards of transparency and openness and be managed 
in compliance with the FAIR principles76.

Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Climate policies are made more inclusive and equitable, facilitating acceptance across 
political and societal stakeholders with various socio-economic and development status, 
both within the EU and globally, enabling high ambition climate action and helping to 
deliver on the European Green Deal’s commitment to “leave no one behind”; 
• There is an improved consensus between the Global North and the Global South within 
the UNFCCC process, unlocking a greater momentum in the implementation of the Paris 
Agreement; 
• The evidence base underpinning IPCC assessments is strengthened, diversified, and 
made more inclusive, facilitating consensus and government approval processes; 
• Social science perspectives on justice and equity are better incorporated into policy 
narratives, scenarios, and models, improving their societal relevance and ensuring that 
climate action strategies are more reflective of the needs, values and concerns of diverse 
societal groups, building trust in results and outcomes, and increasing their uptake 
potential.  
Scope: Climate change and the transition to low-carbon, climate-resilient future raises 
complex justice questions around equitable sharing of benefits and burdens of mitigation and 
adaptation efforts. These considerations not only animate global climate negotiations, but also 
increasingly emerge as a central issue for national politics, legal systems and for the society at 
large. Fairness thus becomes both a critical enabler and a potential barrier for shaping 
ambitious climate action, underscoring the need for prioritising research on advancing just 
climate transitions within the EU and globally. 
For example, mitigation scenarios that have informed and influenced global climate 
policymaking and target-setting, and form a vital component of IPCC assessments, have been 
criticised for not considering fairness more explicitly and systematically, creating a barrier to 
their acceptance as a basis for global mitigation efforts. On the other hand, to avoid 
exacerbating existing vulnerabilities and locking into maladaptive pathways, it is also 
necessary to better account for the justice dimension in adaptation planning and 
implementation.

Actions should advance more comprehensive and interdisciplinary understanding of climate 
justice in the context of the European and global mitigation and adaptation policies, 
promoting awareness, consistency and co-production approaches. They should take into 
consideration socio-economic, territorial and development disparities that exist between and 
within countries, regions and across various segments of the population. Actions should 
address multiple dimensions of justice, diverse spatial and temporal scales (e.g., 
intergenerational justice), and explore the role of a broad range of social, political, economic, 
and cultural contexts and factors. These include both collective (such as values, power 
structures, institutional and legal frameworks, political economy, development models, 
climate elites) and individual (such as age, gender, and intersectionality) features. Building on 
the resulting insights, actions are expected to develop recommendations on how to design, 
implement and evaluate just climate transitions, including definition of specific indicators, 
standards, and criteria to better operationalise the justice concept in adaptation and mitigation 
pathways. Among others, actions should address some of the following aspects 80: 
• Improve integrated assessment models to better represent justice and equity, differences 
in regional outcomes, and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective 
capabilities; 
• Enhance clarity, comparability, and transparency across global mitigation scenarios with 
regard to different justice aspects. Evaluate the feasibility and consistency of regionally 
differentiated long-term mitigation goals in terms of, for example, investments and 
financial flows, governance and institutional needs; 
• Analyse distributional aspects of climate policies, assess consequences for well-being 
and living standards of people from different socio-economic and development contexts. 
Advance research to assess the needs of and the effects on the most vulnerable and 
disadvantaged population segments (e.g., elderly, children, women, migrants, minorities, 
households at risk from energy and/or transport poverty) and sectors, and provide 
recommendations for corrective measures; 
• Assess the trade-offs and co-benefits between climate action and inequality reduction. 
Explore the role of inequality and injustice as constraints to individual and collective 
climate action; 
• Investigate innovative climate policy instruments, initiatives and approaches alternative 
to those prioritising economic efficiency and propose a broader spectrum of climate 
policies with more attention to equity. Assess their feasibility; 
• Investigate justice in the context of sectorial transitions, with focus on under-researched 
(from justice perspective) sectors such as agriculture, forestry and land use; 
 
80 
The evaluation will follow the standard Horizon Europe evaluation criteria, regardless of the number of 
the aspects covered.

Part 8 - Page 58 of 313 
• Advance research on how to better account for the needs and constraints of communities 
representing diversity of vulnerability profiles in disaster risk reduction and adaptation 
strategies.  
Actions should address justice and equity of climate policies both within the EU and from a 
global perspective, but they may choose to prioritise one of these dimensions, using the other 
as framing information. 
The research should be conducted through close collaboration between research teams from 
Europe and low or middle-income countries, hence international cooperation is required (see 
eligibility conditions). Moreover, involvement of key stakeholders and regional experts as 
part of an inclusive process is essential to guarantee that all relevant perspectives are 
adequately represented. The involvement of civil society is also highly recommended. 
All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to connect, coordinate, and 
participate in networking, intercomparison and joint activities, to exploit synergies and 
maximise complementarities. They should also envisage clustering activities with other 
relevant projects (in81 and outside of Horizon Europe) for cross-projects cooperation and 
exchange of results. Proposals should earmark the necessary resources for these purposes. 
This topic is a Societal-Readiness pilot: 
• Proposals should follow the instructions applying to the Societal readiness pilot, as 
described in the introduction of the Horizon Europe Main Work Programme 2025 for 
Climate, Energy and Mobility. They entail the use of an interdisciplinary approach to 
deepening consideration and responsiveness of research and innovation activities to 
societal needs and concerns. 
• This topic requires effective contribution of the relevant SSH expertise, including the 
involvement of SSH experts in the consortium, to meaningfully support Societal 
Readiness. Specifically, SSH expertise is expected to enable the design of project 
objectives with Societal Readiness related activities. Consortia should mobilise a variety 
of SSH research backgrounds, in particular equity, poverty, and gender experts.

Indicative budget 
The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 4.00 million. 
Type of Action 
Coordination and Support Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
If eligible for funding, legal entities established in the African Union 
member states82 may exceptionally participate in this Coordination and 
Support Action as beneficiary or affiliated entity. 
In addition, international organisations with headquarters in a European 
Union Member State, Horizon Europe Associated Country or an African 
Union Member State are also exceptionally eligible to participate (and 
eligible for funding). 
At least 40% of the beneficiaries must be legal entities established in the 
African Union Member States.  
 
Expected Outcome: The action is intended to set the foundation for future collaborative 
activities between the African Union (AU) and the European Union (EU) on climate change 
research in the context of the implementation of the Partnership on Climate Change and 
Sustainable Energy (CCSE)83 under the AU-EU High Level Policy Dialogue (HLPD) on 
Science, Technology, and Innovation84 and its Innovation Agenda85. 
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: 
• Stakeholders, including funding entities, contribute more effectively to the 
implementation of the climate action pillar of the AU-EU CCSE Research and 
Innovation Partnership through an agreed strategy and reinforced R&I coordination; 
• The R&I agendas and initiatives on climate issues relevant for Africa are better aligned 
and defragmented between the EU, national and multilateral levels. The impact of 
funding is enhanced; 
• The climate-related data gap on Africa is reduced and AU countries are better able to 
access, utilise, and deploy state-of-art climate knowledge and services to inform 
decision-making and to accelerate a science-based implementation of the Paris 
Agreement and the Agenda 2030 on Sustainable Development;

• Impacts and risks of climate change are more accurately assessed, adaptation strategies 
are developed, and early warning systems are deployed. This strengthens climate and 
disaster resilience in the AU member states, contributing to the international dimension 
of the EU Adaptation Strategy, the EU Disaster Resilience Goals, the Sendai Framework 
for Disaster Risk Reduction, the Nairobi Declaration and the Early Warnings for All 
initiative; 
• The climate research community in the AU is strengthened, with researchers and 
scientific institutes enabled to engage more effectively in international fora and 
multilateral collaboration networks, with positive effects on diversity and quality of 
climate science and benefiting key international assessments and processes (e.g., IPCC, 
IPBES).   
Scope: African societies and productive sectors are already experiencing widespread impacts 
from both natural hazards and human induced climate change. These include loss of lives and 
biodiversity, increased disease burden, water shortages, ocean acidification, reduced food 
production, and diminished labour efficiency and economic growth. The IPCC warns that 
with additional warming, the risks will further escalate, making a strong case for prioritising 
climate risk reduction and adaptation efforts while transitioning to low-carbon future. 
Socioeconomic, political, and other environmental factors - such as high demographic 
pressure, violent conflicts, biodiversity loss and pollution, unsustainable land and ocean use, 
strong reliance on agriculture and natural resources - interact with climate change to amplify 
the region’s vulnerability. These compounded challenges undermine Africa’s socio-economic 
advancements, hindering its efforts towards sustainable development. Yet, the continent is 
very poorly equipped to deal with these challenges: only 40% of its population has access to 
early warning systems86 – the lowest rate of any region of the world, and many countries lack 
quality climate knowledge and data. 
In addition, despite multiple efforts to promote climate research and capacity development, 
African scientists, scholars, and practitioners are still significantly underrepresented in 
international fora, such as the IPCC. Furthermore, the bulk of research concerning the region 
is performed by groups from developed and emerging countries, not sufficiently incorporating 
indigenous knowledge, local contexts and needs. It is now vital that the assessments of 
climate change, and its related impacts, risks and response strategies are increasingly 
delivered by the African community. 
This action is intended as a preparatory step towards future joint collaborative activities 
between the EU and the AU, and their respective Member States to support the 
implementation of the “Climate Action for adaptation and mitigation” Pillar of the CCSE 
partnership. This pillar encompasses 1) climate-related data, 2) climate services, 3) and an 
integrated knowledge approach to support AU countries in their efforts to implement the Paris 
Agreement. These priorities should be used to frame the activities of the project. The action 
should establish a joint strategy for improving the availability and accelerating the uptake of 
advanced climate knowledge, data, and products across Africa. The aim is to enhance climate

literacy, to develop and increase uptake of climate services and early-warning systems, and to 
support capacity building while taking into consideration the continent’s socio-economic 
circumstances and user needs. It is expected to address all of the following aspects: 
• Develop a joint roadmap identifying priorities, flagship actions and feasible 
implementation architecture (including most appropriate financing instruments, not 
limited to EU level) to pave the way towards more targeted EU-AU cooperation on 
climate change research, with particular focus on climate risk reduction and resilience 
building (to be delivered within the first year of the project); 
• Mobilise and secure commitments from European and African national funding entities 
and other actors (e.g., philanthropies, international cooperation entities and financial 
institutions) necessary to implement joint EU-AU collaborative activities, including a 
potential Horizon Europe co-fund action in 2026-2027 work programme (ideally within 
the first year of the project); 
• Map the relevant EU funded projects (such as CONFER, FOCUS-Africa, 
DOWN2EARTH, 
ALBATROSS, 
SAFE4ALL, 
HABITABLE, 
TEMBO-Africa, 
SINCERE87), match their outputs with the objectives of the CCSE Partnership, and 
cluster them to establish a vibrant community. Develop and implement a strategy to 
consolidate, curate, valorise and disseminate the projects’ outputs towards African and 
European stakeholders to amplify their impact. This should include a user-friendly 
approach (ideally integrated into and complementing existing mechanisms/repositories) 
for sharing best practises and lessons learnt from past and ongoing EU-funded projects, 
and with links to internationally and nationally funded activities, to provide visibility and 
enable scaling and replication of successful initiatives. In addition, the action should also 
investigate how Europe could best learn from Africa and how to valorise, disseminate 
knowledge and implement solutions from the EU Mission on Adaptation to Climate 
Change, other relevant EU Missions and other initiatives (like the Partnership for 
Research and Innovation in the Mediterranean region, PRIMA) that are of relevance to 
the African context; 
• Design and start implementing training and capacity building strategy that should 
enable: i) effective climate action planning and management, ii) enhanced representation 
and diversity of African science and scientists in international fora, iii) upscaled 
generation of policy relevant knowledge, data, products and services, on climate change, 
and iv) a greater participation of women, youth, indigenous and marginalised 
communities.   
The action should bring together core European and African funding agencies (and define a 
credible pathway for mobilising additional funders), research organisations and other key 
African entities such as regional and national climate service centres. Strong representation of 
African partners in the consortium is a core requirement (see eligibility conditions). In 
addition, the action should strive at better connecting scientists, policy makers, practitioners,

and local communities for integrated solutions, at mobilising private sector engagement and at 
promoting the uptake of indigenous knowledge and Citizen Science. Efforts should be made 
to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is managed according to the FAIR 
principles88. 
The action should build on and aim at improving the coordination between existing and 
forthcoming multilateral and bilateral initiatives, such as the Climate Services for Risk 
Reduction in Africa (CS4RRA)89, the ClimSA90 programme, as well as projects funded by the 
EU (Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe) and the JPI-Climate (ERA4CS). Synergies should 
also be sought, where possible, with relevant activities of the World Climate Research 
Programme, the World Adaptation Science Programme, the World Meteorological 
Organisation, the Group on Earth Observations, or the Copernicus programme. It is advisable 
that the action integrates the lessons learnt from the implementation of the energy pillar of the 
CCSE Partnership91.

Cross-sectoral solutions for the climate transition 
This Destination contributes directly to the Strategic Plan’s Key Strategic Orientations 
‘Green transition’, ‘Digital transition’ and ‘A more resilient, competitive, inclusive and 
democratic Europe’. 
In line with the Strategic Plan, the overall expected impact of this Destination is to contribute 
to the “Facilitating a clean and sustainable transition of the energy and transport sectors 
towards climate neutrality through cross-cutting solutions”. 
This Destination covers thematic areas which are cross-cutting by nature and can provide key 
solutions for climate, energy and mobility applications. In line with the scope of cluster 5 such 
areas are batteries, hydrogen92, communities and cities93 and others. Although these areas are 
very distinct in terms of challenges, stakeholder communities and expected impacts, they have 
their cross-cutting nature as a unifying feature and are therefore grouped, if not addressed in 
other places of this work programme, under this Destination. 
The main impacts to be generated by topics under this Destination are: 
Batteries 
• Increased competitiveness and strategic autonomy of EU Battery sector while 
maximising sustainability. 
• Enhanced local and circular supply chains by reducing dependency on critical raw 
materials and upscaling processing capacity, also for recycled materials. 
• An integrated European battery sector for high performance batteries, from design to 
manufacturing and all the way to end of life, reducing environmental impact. 
• Improved resilience of EU energy system and facilitated integration of renewable energy 
sources through application of energy storage. 
• Affordable and reliable batteries to boost the market penetration of Electric Vehicles and 
storage systems.   
Cities and Communities 
This topic is for continuation of the Driving Urban Transition (DUT) co-funded 
partnership to assist cities in their sustainability and climate neutrality transitions. The main 
impacts expected are:

• A credible pathway towards a competitive cost level of 50-75€/kWh at pack level by 
2030.  
Projects are expected to demonstrate the production of cell prototypes at pilot level and 
feasibility of compatibility (or improvement) of the developed materials with regards to at 
least one of the following cell production processes: 
• Dry or aqueous processing technologies; 
• Advanced electrode drying processes; 
• Improved cell formation processes and aging protocols; 
• Improved energy efficiency of processes in dry rooms.  
Proposals are expected to provide the corresponding state-of-the-art benchmark for the

to said benchmark. 
Furthermore, projects are expected to demonstrate the feasibility of compatibility (or 
improvement) of the developed materials with regards to at least one of the following: 
• Design for sorting, dismantling, separation, cost-effective repairing/regeneration, and 
safe recycling (including direct recycling); 
• Adapting Sensing solutions to improve lifetime and state of health detection; 
• Quantification of degradation mechanisms at early stage to determine the best strategy 
for beyond the first life.  
The Commission initiative for Safe and Sustainable by Design96 (SSbD) sets a framework for 
assessing the safety and sustainability of chemicals and materials which should be considered 
as a reference for project proposals. 
Whenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, 
manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the 
plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such 
exploitation. The exploitation plans are expected to include preliminary plans for scalability, 
commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible 
funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund). 
Proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research

• Projected lifetime of 20 years with minimised self-discharge in operating and ambient 
conditions typical of the selected application; 
• Minimum round-trip efficiency of 50% at energy storage system (AC) level and 75% at 
cell level; 
• Large-scale deployment in the long term of reliable materials supply and manufacturing 
of cell or reaction stack.  
Projects are expected to focus on technologies that are presently at a low Technology 
Readiness Level. Lithium-ion, vanadium-based redox flow, sodium-ion using liquid 
electrolyte, molten sodium-sulphur and other commercialised technologies are out of scope of 
this topic. 
Taking the above into account, the scope of the topic is technology neutral. In case the 
following battery chemistries or configurations are chosen, the following points must be 
addressed: 
• For metal-air chemistries: reduce sensitivity to impurities of gases; 
• For multivalent chemistries: develop electrolytes with reduced corrosivity and improved 
compatibility with other cell components and housing; 
• For materials for redox flow chemistries: develop redox couples with minimised share of 
Critical Raw Materials (CRM)101; 
• For Potassium batteries: address rate performance limitations due to potassium ion 
diffusivity and electrolyte decomposition due to high K+/K redox.  
Projects are encouraged to implement calibrated and validated computational models and/or 
(generative) artificial intelligence methods for materials discovery and cell design. 
Whenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, 
manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the 
plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such 
exploitation. The exploitation plans should include preliminary plans for scalability,

Expected Outcome: Project results under this topic are expected to contribute to all of the 
following outcomes: 
• European battery cell manufacturers are supported in their transition from incumbent 
(Gen.3) liquid electrolyte lithium-ion battery to high performance (solid-state) lithium-
ion batteries; 
• Increased diversity of chemistries, cell design (application-oriented) of the existing 
production lines and enabling European Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to 
stay competitive; 
• Scaled production for premium products is targeted in the medium-term (for specific 
applications such as aviation), and large-scale production is targeted in the longer term.   
Scope: The scope covers quasi-solid and all-solid-state lithium-ion battery technologies (up to 
5% liquid electrolyte weight percentage) which encompasses Si-C composite anodes or 
lithium metal anodes. 
Process-Specific Machinery and Technological Upgrades 
Projects are expected to identify and target at least one key manufacturing process for 
enhancement, and to focus on optimising and testing the specific critical process(es) within 
existing production lines rather than overhauling the entire production system. These 
processes must be critical to the transition from liquid electrolyte to solid-state batteries and 
have the potential for high-impact improvements in terms of production yield, quality, cost, 
and sustainability including energy consumption. 
Projects are expected to cover all of the following tasks: 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 75 of 313 
• Provide detailed plans on how existing machinery and systems can be adapted to 
optimise the chosen process, ensuring that these enhancements are both impactful and 
economically viable; 
• Modify existing machinery to better support the specialised requirements of the targeted 
process. This includes enhancing capabilities to handle new materials and designs 
efficiently; 
• Develop and implement technological innovations that specifically enhance the chosen 
process, such as precision manufacturing tools and additive manufacturing.

Projects are expected to conduct pilot testing to validate the feasibility and benefits of the 
enhancements on the chosen process. Proposals are expected to include clear metrics for 
evaluating improvements, such as reductions in energy consumption, increases in production 
yield, and enhancements in product consistency. 
Projects are encouraged to evaluate the impact of the new or improved process on other steps 
in the manufacturing line, including any necessary modifications to adjacent processes, or 
across other parts of the production line and in different manufacturing environments. 
Advanced Materials and Cell Design Integration 
Projects are expected to tailor the design of the produced cell to maximise the benefits of the 
improved process. This can be done through the development of new advanced materials or 
through the integration of existing materials to improve the targeted manufacturing process. 
Digitalisation, Data Integration and Analytics and Process Control 
Projects are expected to cover at least one of the following tasks: 
• Implement advanced control systems and digital technologies that are specifically 
designed to optimise the chosen process, improving efficiency, and reducing waste; 
• Develop new process simulation methods, process models and materials chemistry 
models allowing to virtually assess novel cell designs’ flexible manufacturability at scale 
for adapted existing plants.  
In addition, projects are encouraged to leverage data analytics and data-driven approaches 
(artificial intelligence) to enhance decision-making and process optimisation, focusing on the 
specific needs and challenges of the targeted process. 
Whenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, 
manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the 
plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such

Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes: 
• Shortened development time of battery cells and battery systems by minimising the 
experimental testing effort, thus reducing the overall costs and the time to market; 
• Increased battery reliability and safety through better understanding of ageing, and 
safety-relevant (deactivation, degradation, failure) mechanisms; 
• Acceleration of a more reliable verification and validation of new solutions contributing 
to increased user acceptability (safety, performance & costs) and competitiveness of the 
European battery value chain; 
• Standardised battery system testing & validation approaches focussing on the 
combination of physical and virtual test methodologies.   
Scope: This topic aims to reduce development costs and time to market of new battery 
systems by accelerated multi-physical and virtual testing. Current test strategies are still very 
time consuming and costly due to the need to understand the impact of multi-physical 
operational loads (electric, thermal, mechanical, etc.), potential failure modes, ageing and 
misuse on the safety and reliability of battery cells and modules. 
To overcome these barriers, new multi-physical test strategies supplemented by virtual testing 
are required taking into account the most impactful parameters on ageing, reliability and 
safety and their dependencies. 
Proposals are expected to address Electric Vehicle (EV) batteries and are encouraged to 
develop techniques and methodologies which are applicable to other forms of electro-mobility 
as well as stationary applications (including second life).

Proposals are expected to address and demonstrate all the following activities: 
• Understand and describe the impact of multi-physical operational loads, failure modes, 
ageing and misuse on battery reliability and safety highlighting the dependencies 
between them in order to design the most adequate testing methods and parameters; 
• Derive advanced operating profiles for testing and development of novel X-in-the-Loop 
(XiL) test environments for multi-physical and accelerated testing addressing electrical, 
thermal and mechanical loads at the same time; 
• Combine physics-based with data-driven test strategies enabling reliable virtual and 
physical battery testing considering specific applications; 
• Develop simplified test strategies reducing the number of tests and their complexity 
while improving battery safety and reliability. Synergies between different battery 
chemistries, including next generation battery designs and sizes must be exploited where 
possible, allowing to re-use or scale test results from cell to system level; 
• Research activities are also expected to lead to advanced response strategies for damaged 
and aged batteries. Furthermore, a contribution to the European safety classification 
system is expected by developing standards for this safety classification. To this end, 
proposals are expected to establish contact and exploit complementarities with selected 
proposals under topic HORIZON-CL5-2025-04-D5-03 “Safe post-crash management of 
road Light Duty Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) (2ZERO Partnership)” with regards to 
monitoring techniques for safety risks, algorithms for defining state of health and 
remaining useful life.  
Activities covering the following aspects are encouraged: 
• Development of virtual methods for full system validation using physical sub-system 
results; 
• Development, exploitation, and harmonisation of advanced battery cell or pack 
measurement and diagnostic methods for enhancing the data depth and breadth over 
what is currently available. Definition of performance indicators relating to battery 
degradation and safety, and development of methods for the validation of digital models. 
• Application of AI and generative AI for the definition of the design of experimental and 
testing strategies to increase the outcome of experimental testing campaigns, in order to 
accelerate achievement of significant conclusions, and to thus reduce testing time and 
effort.  
Whenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, 
manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the 
plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such 
exploitation. The exploitation plans are expected to include preliminary plans for scalability,

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 84 of 313 
The partnership is expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: 
• Enhanced multi-level cooperation and alignment on R&I on sustainable urban 
development across and within cities, regions, and countries, including international 
outreach and cooperation with other networks and initiatives; 
• EU is strengthened as a role model for R&I on sustainable urban development; cooperate 
with international cities and research funding networks (e.g., Belmont Forum) to align 
strategies and R&I agendas and strengthen the role of DUT as co-lead of the Urban 
Transitions Mission (UTM) under Mission Innovation (MI). In this context, potential 
synergies could be also considered with ongoing EU funded work related to Africa, to 
enhance the implementation of DUT Strategic Research &Innovation Agenda (SRIA); 
• Set up innovative, cross-sectoral, and inclusive urban governance, policy, and decision-
making harnessing the full potential of social science and citizens’ engagement in the 
city development process; 
• Integrate emerging mobility and transport services, and align them with the citizens’ 
needs and preferences; 
• Foster sustainable, climate-neutral, safe, resilient, socially inclusive, liveable, and 
attractive neighbourhoods, towns, cities and urban services, with reduced environmental 
footprint (e.g., burdens from other pollutants, foster the reuse of materials in view of 
increased integration of circularity aspects) and net-zero greenhouse emissions, and 
enhance well-being and quality of life for citizens; 
• Empower local authorities, municipalities, businesses, social partners, civil society, 
knowledge institutions and citizens with necessary capacity, knowledge and skills; 
deliver efficient urban tools, solutions methodologies and processes to actively engage in 
sustainability and climate-neutrality transitions; 
• Increase science and evidence-based implementation of the European Green Deal, the 
Urban Agenda for the EU and other European, national, regional, and local urban-
relevant policies and strategies (e.g., Circular Economy Action Plan).  
Scope: The objective of this action is to continue to provide support to the European “Driving 
Urban Transitions to a sustainable future ” (DUT) Co-funded Partnership identified in the 
Horizon Europe Strategic Plan 2021-2024 – first implemented under the topic HORIZON-
CL5-2021-D2-01-16: Co-Funded Partnership: Driving Urban Transitions (DUT) – and to 
fund additional activities (which may also be undertaken by additional partners) in line with 
its intended scope and duration, and in accordance with Article 24(2) of the Horizon Europe 
Regulation. 
The proposal should capitalise upon new collaboration opportunities offered by the 
Association Agreements to Horizon Europe, the “EU Climate Neutral and Smart Cities” 
Mission and the Global Urban Transitions Mission (UTM) of Mission Innovation to enhance 
expertise, capacities, critical mass and broaden geographical coverage and outreach capacity. 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 85 of 313 
With respect to international outreach, mutual benefits from collaboration and cooperation 
with global and international cities and research funding networks should be pursued to align 
strategies and research agendas and promote scientific evidence and good practice for urban 
policy at international level. 
Taking into account that the present action is a continuation of topic HORIZON-CL5-2021-
D2-01-16 and HORIZON-CL5-2023-D2-01-08, it foresees an amendment to an existing grant 
agreement, the proposal should describe plans, activities and initiatives that would enable the 
DUT to ensure, as appropriate, a seamless pursuance of its strategy, objectives and actions to 
fill important gaps in knowledge, evidence, innovation, technology, data, capacity and skills, 
integrated approaches, while fostering inclusive and participatory governance structures and 
assisting cities at European (and, as appropriate, global) level in designing and implementing 
the transition towards sustainability and climate neutrality. 
The proposal should describe in detail additional activities (including additional partners) to 
be covered by the grant and justify their added value as compared to ongoing actions, whilst 
accounting for actual progresses in relevant EU and international policy frameworks and 
urban initiatives. The proposal is expected to cover DUT calls for proposals included in the 
work programme (2025-2027). from 2025 to 2027. 
The proposal should elaborate on modalities to scale-up synergies with the works of the 
NetZeroCities Mission Platform, the CapaCITIES coordination and support action and, as 
appropriate, with other EU Missions and related platforms (e.g., MIP4Adapt). Those 
synergies will underpin the implementation of the “EU Climate Neutral and Smart Cities” 
Mission and ensure the coherence and complementarity of activities while leveraging 
knowledge and investment possibilities. 
Furthermore, concrete actions should be envisaged to enhance collaboration and synergies 
with other European Partnerships such as Clean Energy Transitions (CET), Built environment 
and construction (Built4People), Rescuing biodiversity (Biodiversa+), Safe and Sustainable 
Food Systems, Towards Zero Emission Road Transport (2ZERO), Cooperative, Connected 
and Automated Mobility (CCAM), EIT Urban Mobility and Water4All. 
Interfaces with public procurement and investment programmes and links with Urban 
Innovative Actions (UIA) under the Urban Agenda for the EU, the European Urban Initiative 
(EUI) under the Cohesion Policy Funds, private funds, etc. should be explored to support 
take-up and larger scale implementation of tested approaches and solutions. 
The consortium that won the grant under topic HORIZON-CL5-2021-D2-01-16 is uniquely 
placed to submit a proposal to continue the envisioned partnership. It is noted that this 
consortium submitted the initial proposal leading to the identification of the partnership in the 
Horizon Europe strategic planning 2021-2024. Moreover, it has implemented the partnership 
through the co-funded calls in the years 2022 and 2023. In this context, the current consortium 
has specific expertise in relation to the objectives of the Partnership, the activities 
implemented in 2022 and 2023 co-funded calls, or other calls/scope of calls clearly 
required/envisioned pursuant to initial proposal/partnership, and other relevant aspects of the

action. In practice, no other consortium would be able to continue the activities of the 
Partnership underway without a significant disruption of the ongoing activities. 
While the grant under this topic should be attributed to a proposal submitted by the 
coordinator of the consortium funded under topic HORIZON-CL5-2021-D2-01-16, the 
consortium applying to the present topic may include additional partners and new activities, to 
be funded by the grant subject to an evaluation, which will take into account the existing 
context and the scope of the initial evaluation (as relevant), and related obligations enshrined 
in the grant agreement.

Part 8 - Page 87 of 313 
 
Expected Outcome: In addition to renewable hydrogen produced by water electrolysis, there 
is a need to develop other technologies to cover the sustainable hydrogen demand of future 
society including industry, energy and transport. Agricultural, forest and industrial biogenic 
waste resources may offer significant potential for bio-based hydrogen production. R&I in 
this area has been identified as a priority by the EU-India Trade and Technology Council’s 
Working Group on Green and Clean Energy Technology to reinforce bilateral cooperation. 
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: 
• Renewable hydrogen producers and consumers based in the EU and India benefit from 
improved sustainability, safety, and affordability of renewable hydrogen production 
technologies from biogenic wastes (compared to existing ones); 
• Technology developers based in the EU and India benefit from the expanded portfolio of 
renewable hydrogen production concepts through biogenic wastes use; 
• Stakeholders on renewable hydrogen production based in the EU and India benefit from 
each other’s experience on renewable hydrogen from biogenic wastes; 
• The cooperation between EU and India key researchers, institutions and industries which 
are active in biogenic waste to renewable hydrogen research is supported and 
strengthened.   
Scope: The topic aims at developing innovative technologies to produce renewable hydrogen 
from biogenic wastes without recycling potential such as agricultural, forest and biogenic part 
of municipal wastes, sewage sludge and industrial waste waters, through biochemical and 
thermochemical Waste to renewable Hydrogen (W2rH) pathways. Focus will be on increasing 
the resource efficiency (carbon to hydrogen yield), reducing the GHG emissions or even 
generating a negative carbon footprint, decreasing environmental footprint for pollution and 
water consumption, and significantly reducing the production cost of hydrogen. Use of 
advanced catalysts to enhance primary conversion or upgrading of the intermediate from 
primary conversion or process intensification methods including advanced reactor 
technologies are in the scope. Utilisation of side streams such as aqueous and gaseous streams 
from primary conversion and/or their further conversion using biological, electrochemical, 
biochemical and/or catalytic technologies are in the scope as well. Development of feedstock 
pretreatment methods including sorting and post-treatment technologies required for hydrogen 
purification could be included in the projects. 
An assessment of the feedstock cost supply at regional and local level suitable for the selected 
conversion technology and improvement of feedstock mobilisation patterns including via 
enabling technologies, such as digitalisation, should be performed. Preliminary economic 
feasibility as well as socioeconomic and environmental sustainability of the developed 
concept including assessing potential impacts on land use, water use, biodiversity, and 
greenhouse gas emissions, as well as social impacts, are expected to be assessed by the project 
on a life-cycle analysis basis. The production cost of the W2rH pathway should be compared 
to the state-of-the art production technologies of renewable hydrogen and with aim to be 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 88 of 313 
reduced. Projects should develop an overall process concept using advanced modelling 
techniques including flowsheet modelling for mass and energy flows. 
Safety aspects and ways to increase safety concerning the hydrogen and other gaseous and 
system component leakages are expected to be addressed in a ‘hydrogen safety planning and 
management’ plan at the project level. Project developers are encouraged to contact the 
European Hydrogen Safety Panel (EHSP) 117  established under the Clean Hydrogen 
Partnership to benefit from the developed experience in safety issues for hydrogen systems. 
The projects should lead to commercially viable and economically interesting pathways when 
upscaled. 
Organic waste being not biogenic is not in the scope of the call. 
The exploitation of results, including IPR, should be appropriately addressed in the proposal. 
Joint work should benefit from the Indian and European experience in W2rH. Linked EU and 
Indian projects should have the same start date, the same duration, and same targets. 
Proposals must show clearly how the coordination among them will bring added scientific 
value. To ensure a project implementation that reflects a genuine EU-Indian cooperation, 
linked projects should include properly coordinated research activities between EU and India 
in the Work Plan of the two coordinated projects.  
Proposals will include detailed explanations about tasks and effort of the coordinated proposal 
as a whole and cross-references to the e proposal for the linked project. 
This topic aims at exploiting synergies between India and Europe in terms of scientific 
expertise and resources in topics related to W2rH production by implementing coordinated 
projects. Potential areas for collaboration (i.e. the coordinated part of the call) could include 
(but are not limited to) optimising fermentation and thermochemical processes, developing 
new catalysts, and improving separation techniques, as well as assessment of sustainability, 
technoeconomic feasibility and safety aspects including by using advanced process modelling. 
The topic falls within the scope of the EU-India Strategic Partnership and the EU-India Trade 
and Technology Council in relation to waste to renewable hydrogen. For the purposes of this 
topic, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy of the Government of India (MNRE) has 
made the required funding available for the coordinated projects of the Indian side118. A 
balanced effort and matched budget between Europe and India regarding the two coordinated 
projects are expected. 
In order to maximise synergies and increase the impact of the projects under this topic, 
proposals selected for funding under this topic will be required to participate in common 
networking and joint activities. Without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities, 
proposals should allocate a sufficient budget for the attendance of joint meetings periodically.

relevant parts of society are accounted for in an integrated way to ensure broad and 
sustainable support for R&I solutions; 
• The next generation of Societal Readiness projects benefits from current pilot projects’ 
experiences, success stories and do’s and don’ts thanks to a public web platform, acting 
as a one-stop-shop for Societal Readiness for future EU projects; 
• The European Commission is equipped with a sound, clear, and replicable procedure – 
both at implementation and content level – presented as an improvement of the current 
approach, to address Societal Readiness effectively in future EU funded R&I projects.   
Scope: The European Commission has a strong interest in learning from the implementation 
of Societal Readiness actions piloted in eight topics from the Cluster 5 work programme 
2025122, and resulting in an estimate of eighteen projects to be implemented. Conclusions on 
the pilot’s monitoring and evaluation will be the basis for the European Commission’s 
decision to replicate further these actions, to improve its implementation and possibly widen 
its use to other fields of application. 
The instructions and definitions applying to pilot topics are included in the introduction of the 
Horizon Europe Main Work Programme 2025 for Climate, Energy and Mobility. 
The action is expected to analyse the way Societal Readiness is addressed and integrated in 
piloted projects and help in designing an efficient, clear, and impactful way of applying a 
Societal Readiness approach in future EU funded R&I projects with a true interdisciplinary 
collaboration. 
The project selected should address all of the following actions: 
• Make a consolidated analysis:         
 on the way Societal Readiness is considered and integrated in the Descriptions of 
the Actions 123 of selected pilot-projects in terms of content (e.g., the type of 
Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) guiding questions chosen and related 
methodology), implementation (e.g., SR related work distribution and partners) and 
methodology. Assess the level, timing, and quality of interactions between SSH and 
STEM partners during the proposal preparation.    
 of all First reports on Societal Readiness to be delivered by the selected pilot-
projects. Assess the way SR consideration unfolds from the Description of the 
Actions’ methodology, observe how guiding questions are addressed and plan to 
respond to the concerns identified. Compare the various ‘SR visions’ put forward 
by each consortium.

 of all Final reports on Societal Readiness to be delivered by the selected pilot-
projects. Assess the various projects’ experiences, challenges and lessons learned 
during the actual implementation of the Societal Readiness activities, looking at the 
participation and type of external actors in co-design methods, responses to SR 
guiding questions, possible adjustment of R&I activities.   
Mid-project recommendations based on the two first points are expected in order to give a 
preliminary sense of directionality for future Societal Readiness projects. 
• Analyse the various interdisciplinarity mechanisms (SSH vs. STEM, collaboration with 
societal stakeholders) across pilot-projects as well as their effectiveness in practice. 
Identify successful interdisciplinary approaches and less successful ones. Possible 
evolutions in partners behaviours, or changes in interdisciplinary strategies should be 
identified. The degree of involvement from partners in SR activities, as well as the way 
they perceive them (in a positive or negative way) should also be scrutinised. This 
analysis should result in a publication with concrete tips helping future project partners 
integrating implementable, efficient, and well-accepted interdisciplinary practices both 
within consortia and towards external actors. 
• Organise annual workshops in physical format to allow all pilot project representatives 
to meet, interact and exchange experiences periodically. Travel costs for all participants 
are to be covered by this action. 
• Set up a public web platform during the action duration, to provide a direct source of 
support to future SR users, including examples of SR pathways, do’s and don’ts, tips and 
tricks specifically tailored to facilitate the use and understanding of the European 
Commission’s approach on Societal Readiness. A survey submitted beforehand to pilot-
projects partners could be envisaged to help in defining those needs. The platform should 
be updated and completed on a regular basis. 
• Eventually provide a set of recommendations to the European Commission taking 
stock of the work achieved as well as of the recommendations elaborated by pilot-
projects in their Final reports on Societal Readiness. Practical improvements of the 
current Societal Readiness approach should be proposed to overcome identified 
shortcomings, while at the same time, acknowledging the successful aspects of the 
current approach. The overall Societal Readiness vision124 should be kept in mind when 
providing those recommendations, while aiming at keeping a lowest level of 
implementation complexity, a highest degree of understandability (including for non-
SSH experts) and replicability to various technology maturities and fields of 
applications, as well as a strong interdisciplinary component.  
 
124 
Societal Readiness is an indication of R&I results, expressing they have accounted for different societal 
needs and concerns, thereby increasing its potential for societal uptake and transition towards societal 
adaptation. Working towards Societal Readiness means to better understand that R&I should be driven 
by the needs, values, and expectations of diverse social groups, inclusive and transparent in processes 
and outcomes, active in identifying, mitigating, and avoiding negative social, environmental, and 
economic externalities.

An analysis of the added value of SR pilot topics compared to SSH-flagged-only-topics 
within Cluster 5 as well as of other relevant Societal Readiness routes (e.g. at national level) 
applied to R&I projects in the area of Climate, Energy and/or Mobility should be performed. 
Successful practices identified may complement recommendations to be provided to the 
Commission. 
Information on e.g. on perceptions, feelings, concerns, past experiences on ways of working 
that is not translated into projects’ documents should be collected via direct interactions 
(bilateral discussions with respective project partners). 
The action should also initiate similar monitoring activities on Societal Readiness pilot 
projects funded under future Horizon Europe work programmes, whenever operational phases 
of this action and new pilot projects overlap. 
A duration of 42 months is recommended for this action. 
The proposed action requires the effective contribution of relevant SSH disciplines including 
the involvement of SSH experts to proficiently support the monitoring and evaluation of 
Societal Readiness pilot-projects in Cluster 5 work programme 2025.

The partnership is expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: 
• Increased directionality of clean energy transition research and innovation in EU and 
Associated Countries in line with the SET Plan thanks to a shared pan-European vision 
on the goal and direction of required system transformation processes, adapted to 
regional needs and availability of renewable energy resources; 
• Evidence based energy and climate policy formulation; 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 94 of 313 
• A wider systemic transition and energy supply required for a climate neutral economy in 
all sectors of society; enabling the transition of the built environment, transport, industry 
and other sectors to clean, low carbon energy; 
• An innovation ecosystem for Europe's transition to clean energy and contribution to a 
resource and energy efficient system, both from an ecological and economic standpoint; 
• A building block to a zero-emission energy system for the decarbonisation of transport, 
buildings, industry, agriculture in the specific European environment; 
• Increased engagement of consumers and prosumers as well as fair and appropriate 
demand-response mechanisms integrated in the energy system; 
• An energy system that meets the needs of different parts of society, in different 
geographical locations (urban and rural) and different groups.  
Scope: The Clean Energy Transition co-funded Partnership (CET Partnership) is a 
transnational initiative on joint R&I programming to boost and accelerate the energy 
transition, building upon regional and national R&I funding programmes. 
It aims at empowering the energy transition and contributing to the EU goal of becoming the 
first climate-neutral continent by 2050, by pooling national and regional R&I funding for a 
broad variety of technologies and system solutions required to achieve the transition. It will 
foster innovation ecosystems from the very local and regional level, up to the transnational 
European level, thus overcoming a fragmented European landscape. The CET Partnership 
enables national and regional R&I programme owners and managers from Member States and 
Associated Countries to align their priorities and implement annual joint calls from 2022 to 
2027. The Partnership also organises joint accompanying activities to enable a dynamic 
learning process, extracts strategic knowledge and accelerates the upscaling, replication, and 
market diffusion of innovative solutions to maximise impact and foster the uptake of cost-
effective clean energy technologies. 
The common vision of the CET Partnership is already expressed in its Strategic Research and 
Innovation Agenda (SRIA) that has been co-created with the involved countries, the EU SET 
Plan Implementation Working Groups and ETIPs, all energy relevant ERA-Nets as well as the 
EERA joint programmes (over 500 editors, co-authors, commenters, and discussants). The 
SRIA articulates the common goal of (1) building a transnational transformative Joint 
Programming Platform, (2) developing and demonstrating technology and solutions for the 
transition of energy systems, and finally (3) building innovation ecosystems that support 
capacity building at all levels. 
The objective of this action is to continue to provide support to the European Clean Energy 
Transition Co-fund Partnership identified in the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan 2021-2024 
and first implemented under topic HORIZON-CL5-2021-D3-01-04, and in particular to fund 
additional activities (which may also be undertaken by additional partners) in view of its 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 95 of 313 
intended scope and duration, and in accordance with Article 24(2) of the Horizon Europe 
Regulation. 
The new geopolitical and energy market realities require to drastically accelerate the clean 
energy transition and increase energy independence from unreliable suppliers and volatile 
fossil fuels. In support to the objectives of REPowerEU125 it is expected that the partnership 
explores pathways and develops new actions to reinforce R&I investments (and utilisation of 
R&I results) accelerating the clean energy transition. 
It is expected that the European Clean Energy Transition Co-Fund Partnership reinforces its 
ambition considering the revised SET Plan and continues the implementation of its SRIA by 
setting up joint calls in 2025, 2026 and 2027. In addition, the partnership is invited to setup 
joint calls without co-funding from the European Union. 
The consortium that won the grant under topic HORIZON-CL5-2021-D3-01-04 is uniquely 
placed to submit a proposal to continue the envisioned partnership. With regards to the 
various activities already undertaken in previous years, no other consortium is able to 
continue the activities of the Partnership underway without a significant disruption of the 
ongoing activities. 
While the grant under this topic should be attributed to a proposal submitted by the 
coordinator of the consortium funded under topic HORIZON-CL5-2021-D3-01-04, the 
consortium applying to the present topic may include additional partners and new activities, to 
be funded by the grant subject to an evaluation, which will take into account the existing 
context and the scope of the initial evaluation (as relevant), and related obligations enshrined 
in the grant agreement.

Plan, its strategic objectives were harmonised with the European Green Deal, REPowerEU 
and the Green Deal Industrial Plan. Moreover, the SET Plan became a structural policy under 
the European Research Area. In 2024, the SET Plan was enshrined in the Net Zero Industry 
Act and the SET Plan Steering Group was established as a high-level expert group. 
Depending on the sector, European Technology and Innovation Platforms (ETIPs), and/or 
SET Plan Implementation Working Groups (IWGs) and/or similar stakeholder fora support 
the development and implementation of the SET Plan priorities by bringing together relevant 
stakeholders in key areas from industry, research organisations and, where applicable, SET 
Plan countries’ government representatives. 
It is crucial for the clean energy transition that the SET Plan stakeholder fora align and 
coordinate their activities. 
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes: 
• European climate and energy policies are supported by science-based evidence. 
• The implementation of the SET Plan and its contribution to the Green Deal Industrial 
Plan, the Net Zero Industry Act and the European Research Area are facilitated. 
• The SET Plan stakeholder fora are recognised as key players in the clean energy 
transition. 
• The societal and economic effects of the clean energy transition are addressed through 
the consideration of interests, needs and concerns of end users and actors across the 
value chain of the respective technology sectors.   
Scope: The projects are expected to support ETIPs and/or IWGs and/or stakeholder fora in 
one of the sectors listed below, taking into consideration the specific needs of the sector they 
address, the emerging European policy priorities, and the coordination with other initiatives 
(to avoid overlaps). 
The proposals are expected to address one of the following sectors: geothermal energy, 
hydropower, ocean energy, photovoltaics, renewable fuels and bioenergy, solar thermal 
energy, renewable heating and cooling, direct solar fuels, wind energy, energy efficiency in 
buildings, sustainable and efficient energy use in industry, direct current technologies, carbon 
capture storage and use, hydrogen, and energy systems. 
In line with the Recovery Plan for Europe and the latest EU climate and energy related 
policies (notably the National Energy and Climate Plans), stakeholder fora are expected to 
develop research and innovation roadmaps and/or analyses (e.g., strategic research and 
innovation agendas, strategic reports, industrial strategies, analyses of market opportunities 
and funding needs, studies on innovation barriers, assessments of their sectors’ contribution to 
the European competitiveness and strategic autonomy). Special attention should be given, as 
appropriate, to the key challenges of the European Green Deal, the Green Deal Industrial Plan 
and the Net Zero Industry Act, including (but not limited to) energy security, technological 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 98 of 313 
pushback, industrial production and competitiveness, supply chain security and dependencies, 
access to market, circularity, advanced materials, digitalisation, societal transformation, skills, 
and just transition. Moreover, as appropriate, the projects are expected to address the 
contribution to the goals of the European Research Area in the field of energy, in particular 
the achievement of the 3% GDP target of public and private spending on research and 
innovation. 
The stakeholder fora should ensure the participation of industrial players (including SMEs), 
research and civil society organisations, universities and European associations representing 
relevant sectors (as applicable) across several SET Plan countries, establishing links with 
national authorities. To maximise impact, the projects are encouraged to develop and 
implement robust outreach approaches to widen participation from across the EU and 
associated countries. As appropriate, societal needs and interests should be considered in the 
activities of the fora, so that inequalities and employment issues are addressed. Where 
applicable, the stakeholder fora should establish synergies with relevant Horizon Europe 
European Partnerships. 
The projects are encouraged to implement dissemination and networking activities with other 
relevant projects (e.g., joint workshops, thematic conferences, webinar series, regular 
exchanges, etc.). 
Relevant outputs of the projects will feed into the SET Plan information system (SETIS), the 
annual SET Plan progress report and the Commission’s Clean Energy Technology 
Observatory. As appropriate, the projects should provide data and analysis tracking the 
progress of the different technologies towards the EU targets, for instance those set out by the 
Net Zero Industry Act (e.g., the implementation of non-price criteria), the Critical Raw 
Materials Act, and the Renewable Energy Directive (e.g., the target for innovative renewable 
energy technologies to represent at least 5 % of newly installed renewable energy capacity by 
2030). Data should be accessible and reusable according to the FAIR data principles 
(Findable, Accessible, Reusable, Interoperable). The projects are expected to contribute to the 
reporting of the SET Plan to the European Parliament and the Council. 
The projects should prepare new (or update existing) finance and sustainability plans for 
future continuation of the stakeholder fora without EU funding. 
If relevant, this topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the 
involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, to 
produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related 
research activities. 
The indicative project duration is two years.

Expected Outcome: The framework of measures for strengthening Europe’s net-zero 
technology manufacturing ecosystem (Net-Zero Industry Act) was adopted 128  in 2024, 
establishing a requirement for Member States to set up net-zero regulatory sandboxes129 in 
order to promote innovation and regulatory learning in the field of net-zero technologies. This 
instrument allows for testing of innovative net-zero technologies in real-world environment 
for a limited amount of time and with a view of potential scaling up and further wider 
deployment. Those innovative technologies could eventually be essential to achieve the 
Union’s climate neutrality objective and to ensure the security of supply and resilience of the 
Union’s energy system. Regulatory sandboxes contribute to better regulation130 and to the 
New European Innovation Agenda’s131 flagship on experimentation spaces. 
According to the Regulation, Member States designate one or more contact points for setting 
up net zero regulatory sandboxes and the net zero Europe Platform is assigned to coordinate 
Member States’ activities and cooperation on net zero regulatory sandboxes. For the wider 
and accelerated deployment of innovative net-zero technologies it is crucial that the assigned 
contact points and competent authorities coordinate their activities, exchange information on

lessons learnt and good practices and cooperate, including possible cross-border 
implementation. 
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes: 
• Regulatory learning of how regulation supports or hampers the enhanced use of 
innovative net-zero technologies; 
• Net zero regulatory sandboxes schemes are well established, streamlined and designed; 
• The net zero Europe Platform actively and smoothly exchanges information among 
Member States (contact points and competent authorities) and stakeholders thanks to the 
support of the project.   
Scope: Covering all of the following points proposals are expected to:   
1. Provide support to the goals of the net zero Europe Platform related to net zero 
regulatory sandboxes and to reach out to stakeholders involved in net zero regulatory 
sandboxes across Member States (including assigned contact points, competent 
authorities, potential participating entities, including SMEs and start-ups, social partners, 
consumers and other stakeholders). They should support exchanging best practices, 
lessons learnt and enhancing cooperation between Member States, as well as the 
coordination with other similar initiatives. 
2. Prepare comparative analyses and assessments of the national legislative frameworks for 
net zero regulatory sandboxes and other regulatory sandboxes relevant for innovative net 
zero technologies in line with the Regulation on strengthening Europe’s net-zero 
technology manufacturing ecosystem:        
 on regulatory barriers for innovative net zero technologies;    
 on national net-zero regulatory sandbox schemes (including application 
procedures);    
 on concrete trials;    
 on impacts and regulatory learning;    
 on lessons learnt    
 and explore other forms of regulatory experimentation for net zero technologies in 
the energy sector.   
3. Create and regularly update a publicly available free repository on regulatory sandbox 
schemes and concrete projects for net zero technologies in the Union.  
Proposals actively include the contribution of national and regional authorities, companies 
(industry and SMEs), social partners, research and civil society organisations, consumers’ and 
users’ associations, universities and European associations representing relevant sectors and 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 101 of 313 
any other stakeholders related to net zero regulatory sandboxes. To maximise their impact and 
widen participation, they are encouraged to develop and implement robust outreach 
approaches and societal engagement actions to span across the EU. 
Proposals are expected to include appropriate means to particularly take into account the 
experience and possibilities of SMEs and start-ups as potential participants in regulatory 
sandbox schemes fostering innovation and regulatory learning. 
Furthermore, the proposals should develop a dissemination and exploitation strategy and 
implement dissemination and networking activities. 
The project is expected to contribute to the Commission’s reporting on the results of the 
implementation of net-zero regulatory sandboxes (including good practices, lessons learnt and 
recommendations on their setup and, on the application, within the net-zero regulatory 
sandbox of Union law in a manner adapted for the purposes of the net-zero regulatory 
sandbox). 
Proposals submitted under this topic are expected to include actions designed to ensure the 
accessibility and reusability of data produced during the project. The project should include a 
finance and sustainability plan for future continuation beyond the lifetime of the project. 
Projects should be designed for a duration of three years.

Sustainable, secure and competitive energy supply 
This Destination includes activities targeting a sustainable, secure and competitive energy 
supply. In line with the scope of cluster 5, this includes activities in the areas of renewable 
energy; energy system, grids and storage; as well as Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage 
(CCUS). 
This Destination contributes directly to the Strategic Plan’s Key Strategic Orientations 
‘Green transition’, ‘Digital transition’ and ‘A more resilient, competitive, inclusive and 
democratic Europe’. 
In line with the Strategic Plan, the overall expected impact of this Destination is to contribute 
to the ‘Ensuring more sustainable, secure and competitive energy supply through solutions 
for smart energy systems based on renewable energy solutions’. 
This destination contributes to the activities of the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET 
Plan) and its implementation working groups. 
The main impacts to be generated by topics under this Destination are: 
Renewable energy    
1. Energy producers have access to competitive European renewable energy and renewable 
fuel technologies and deploy them to enhance the EU’s energy security. This will 
contribute to the 2030 “Fit for 55” targets (in particular, at least 42.5% renewable energy 
share and aiming for 45% in the EU energy consumption, 5.5% advanced biofuels and 
renewable fuels of non-biological origin share in EU fuel consumption). It will also 
contribute to the indicative target of at least 5% innovative renewable energy technology 
for the newly installed renewable energy capacity. By 2050, climate neutrality in the 
energy sector will be achieved in a sustainable way in environmental (e.g., biodiversity, 
multiple uses of land and water, natural resources, pollution) and socioeconomic terms, 
and in line with the Sustainable Development Goals. 
2. Technology providers have access to European, reliable, sustainable, and affordable 
value chains of renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies. 
3. Economic sectors benefit from better integration of renewable energy and renewable 
fuel-based solutions that are among others cost-effective, efficient, flexible, reliable, and 
sustainable. Such integration is facilitated by digital technologies and by renewable 
energy technologies that provide network stability and reliability. 
4. European researchers benefit from a stronger community and from a reinforced scientific 
basis on renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies, also through international 
collaborations. 
5. European industries benefit from a reinforced export potential of renewable energy and 
renewable fuel technologies, also through international collaborations. 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 103 of 313 
6. European industries become frontrunners and maintain technological leadership in 
innovative renewable energy technologies in line with the energy union strategy. 
7. European citizens, including disadvantaged and vulnerable groups, have access to an 
energy market that is affordable, fair and equitable, more resilient, uses all different 
types of local renewable energy resources, and is less dependent on fossil fuels. Local 
communities benefit from a more decentralised and secure energy system and from 
multiple uses of land and water. Less citizens experience fuel and energy poverty. 
8. Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) implementation working groups on solar 
photovoltaics, solar thermal technologies, renewable fuels and bioenergy, wind energy, 
geothermal energy, and ocean energy benefit from a reinforced scientific basis and 
collaboration on renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies towards meeting the 
ambitious targets of the European Green Deal.   
Energy systems, grids & storage 
R&I actions will support the just digital and green transformation of the energy system 
through advanced solutions for accelerating the energy systems integration and 
decarbonisation. The developed clean, sustainable solutions will contribute to making the 
energy system and supply more reliable, resilient, and secure. The solutions will contribute to 
increase flexibility and grid hosting capacity for renewables through optimising cross sector 
integration and grid scale storage. They will enhance the competitiveness of the European 
value chain, reduce pressure on resources (also by making technologies ‘circular by design’) 
and decrease dependencies. 
Innovative and cost-effective energy storage (integration) solutions are developed, that 
provide flexibility to the energy system, reduce total cost of grid operation and enhancement 
and that minimise the use of critical raw materials and ensure, to the best extent possible, their 
reuse and recycling, are key elements of the energy system. 
Carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) and carbon dioxide removal (CDR)    
1. Accelerated development of carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) as a CO2 emission 
mitigation option in electricity generation, in industry applications and carbon dioxide 
removal technologies (including conversion of CO2 to energy products). 
2. Reduced EU’s dependency on imported fossil fuels and increased energy security, 
reduced energy system’s vulnerability to the impacts of the changing climate.

Procedure 
The procedure is described in General Annex F. The following exceptions 
apply: 
To ensure a balanced portfolio, grants will be awarded to proposals not 
only in order of ranking but at least also to one proposal that is the highest 
ranked within the area of liquid advanced biofuels and at least also to one 
proposal that is the highest ranked within the area of liquid renewable 
fuels of non-biological origin, provided that proposals attain all thresholds 
(and subject to available budget). This condition to ensure a balanced 
portfolio will also be considered to be met if a proposal addressing both 
areas is funded. 
 
Expected Outcome: A quite wide portfolio of technologies, which are close to be deployed 
but still lack the real-world demonstration of economic viability, exists. Significant volumes 
of advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBOs) are needed to 
cover the current fleets and the sectors where renewable fuels are the main long-term solution, 
such as aviation and shipping and energy-intensive industries. Therefore, an exceptional effort 
is needed to establish more successful projects where full-scale plants are built and operated 
based on the vast potential of sustainable feedstocks throughout the EU. 
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: 
• Energy producers and consumers in transport and energy-intensive industries benefit 
from the mobilisation of building of industrial capacity for advanced biofuels and 
renewable fuels of non-biological origin; 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 105 of 313 
• Technology developers benefit from the support to the preparation of first-of-a-kind 
plants of advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin to become 
precursors for the following commercial plants; 
• Technology providers benefit from the de-risking of the innovative technologies, 
reduction of CAPEX and production costs, boosting of scale-up and contribution to 
market up-take of advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin; 
• Public authorities, citizens, researchers, and industrial stakeholders benefit from the 
improvement of the sustainability, reliability, robustness, and security of the relevant 
value chain; 
• National authorities profit from the provided evidence for innovative advanced biofuels 
and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin technologies, which can contribute to the 
Renewable Energy Directive indicative target for innovative renewable energy 
technology in each Member State of at least 5 % of newly installed renewable energy 
capacity by 2030, as well as to the targets under ReFuelEU Aviation and FuelEU 
Maritime.  
• Policy makers and regulators profit from the provided factual information and evidence 
in view of their decision as regards accelerating permitting procedures, harvesting 
benefits from multiple uses of land and water and increasing the responsiveness of 
research and innovation in that field to diverse societal interests and concerns;  
• The implementation of the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) Action for 
Renewable Fuels and Bioenergy is supported and facilitated.  
Scope: Demonstrate innovative large-scale production of liquid advanced biofuels and/or 
renewable fuels of non-biological origin for sectors with specific need for such fuels 
(particularly aviation and shipping and energy-intensive industries). Production is expected to 
be based on various EU sustainable biomass feedstocks, notably biogenic residues and wastes, 
biogenic part of slurries and industrial wastes, and/or on non-biological origin feedstocks, 
such as renewable hydrogen and CO2 or renewable carbon, nitrogen, or their compounds, 
through chemical, biochemical, biological, and thermochemical pathways, or a combination 
of them. Proposals are expected to: 
• demonstrate large scale production of ready-to-deploy advanced biofuels and/or 
renewable fuels of non-biological origin, engaging feedstock developers and suppliers, 
technology developers, fuel suppliers, end users for purchasing the quantities, national 
bodies, and public or private authorities with funding capacity; 
• address and assess the impact of actual, real-size feedstocks, (like for example 
agricultural wastes, energy crops grown on marginal and degraded lands or as 
intermediate crops, forestry wastes, biogenic municipal and industrial wastes, all types of 
renewable hydrogen, actual streams of CO2 and nitrogen, available renewable carbon or 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 106 of 313 
their compounds), in terms of their constitution on plant design, (e.g. for feedstock 
pretreatment and wastewater treatment as appropriate); 
• address and assess the impact on plant design and feasibility of improving the feedstocks 
externally and upstream to the fuel production plant, by increasing the energy density of 
the feedstocks through for example torrefaction, by homogenisation of feedstocks for 
making them uniform or similar, and by standardisation of feedstocks, as appropriate.  
Projects should produce a lifetime cycle analysis of their production route and in particular for 
renewable fuels of non-biological origin, as inputs in terms of renewable energy and material 
(CO2, nitrogen, renewable hydrogen) may not be continuously available. 
Production of renewable hydrogen as an end-product is excluded from the scope of this topic. 
The projects are expected to result in reference cases for ready-to-build, revamp/reuse and/or 
operate full-scale plants of advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin. 
Improvements, optimisation, new schemes and modification of existing demonstration plants 
that can result into the preparation of the next full-scale plant are considered within scope to 
encourage deployment of cost-effective solutions. 
The plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results should include a strong investment 
and business case and sound exploitation strategy. The exploitation plan should include plans 
for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment. It is expected to provide information and 
assessment about the economic viability of the commercial plant, the permitting procedures, a 
full value chain-based business plan and identified funding sources such as private equity, 
loans, loans guarantee, grants, or public financing for CAPEX and OPEX, as well as take-off 
agreements for the fuel uptake. Moreover, they should provide information on, or linked to, 
the identified funding sources, like private equity, the InvestEU, the EU Catalyst Partnership, 
the Innovation Fund, and possibly the European Regional Development Fund programmes. 
Projects are expected to include at least one relevant local economic business case, outlining 
local value and supply chains and the expected number of local jobs at the place of 
deployment. Furthermore, proposals are expected to provide information and assessment of 
impact on land and water use, soil and biodiversity, for example in relation to marginal and 
degraded land feedstocks, and of public awareness on full-scale renewable fuel plants. 
An assessment of the sustainability and the GHG reduction from fossil equivalents should be 
shown based on a life-cycle analysis for the large-scale fuel production. Special attention 
should be paid to estimating the GHG emissions reduction potential; projects are encouraged 
to use the methodology in the Innovation Fund.

Expected Outcome: European energy security and industrial competitiveness are contested by 
the geopolitical circumstances and market situations around the world. Advanced biofuels and 
renewable fuels of non-biological origin are in EU’s portfolio of technologies that contribute 
to net-zero manufacturing in Europe. However, remaining challenges impacting the security 
of supply and competitiveness of these technologies and the integration of their value chains 
need to be clearly understood, presented, and mitigated. 
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: 
• Energy consumers benefit from the contribution to improved EU energy security and 
industrial competitiveness of renewable fuel technologies; 
• Energy producers and consumers benefit from the improved reliability, robustness and 
security of renewable fuel technologies (compared to existing ones); 
• Diverse stakeholders, e.g., policy makers, public authorities, citizens, researchers, and 
industry, profit from the enhancement of common knowledge and understanding about 
existing opportunities of integrated value chains for advanced biofuels and renewable 
fuels of non-biological origin; 
• Multi stakeholders, e.g., policy makers, technology developers, researchers, industrial 
and any other relevant stakeholders to the value chain, profit from the generation of

multi benefits of promoting sustainable development and sustainable agriculture 
regarding climate change resilience and regenerative practices, accelerating renewable 
fuel innovation, and maximising carbon removals.  
Scope: Projects are expected to assess the energy security and industrial competitiveness 
aspects of value chains for advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin, in 
view of the new situation in the EU regarding energy security and industrial competitiveness 
with the rest of the word. They are expected to also evaluate how these technologies could 
contribute to the EU’s energy security and industrial competitiveness through detailed value 
chain analysis and development of future scenarios, macroeconomic modelling, and strategic 
decision-making methods. Value chains closer to commercialisation with the potential to 
contribute more to the EU 2030 targets for green transition and industrial competitiveness and 
value chains for technologies under development with the potential to contribute to the longer 
term and could duly adopt mitigation measures, are both in scope. Proposals are expected to 
identify the research and innovation actions needed to improve the energy security and 
industrial competitiveness aspects of these value chains, and implement as appropriate 
research activities for such optimisation, as well as new standards definitions for advanced 
biofuels and RFNBOs as appropriate. 
Competitiveness, energy security and integration challenges of the various steps in a value 
chain and of the relevant stakeholders are expected to be addressed. Integration aspects 
encompass every step of each individual value chain and every stakeholder. Proposals are 
expected to coordinate efforts towards development of win-win integrated solutions of 
sustainable value chains for advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin 
engaging all relevant stakeholders, including as relevant farmers, CO2 suppliers, technology 
providers, researchers, fuel producers, end users, policy makers, international organisations. 
Multidisciplinary issues related to advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological 
origin production, carbon removals, CO2 trading and valorisation, sustainable farming, 
production of nature-based soil amendments, fertilizers, and organic materials, fuel 
standardisation, trade-off/synergies of carbon farming with in-situ carbon storing and of land 
uses for fuels versus solar panels for derived fuels, are expected to be considered, to achieve 
benefits for all through the integration. 
Value chains of renewable hydrogen as an end-product are not within the scope of this topic. 
A sustainability assessment of integrated solutions including techno-economic, environmental 
and social aspects is expected to be carried out based on life cycle analysis.

To ensure a balanced portfolio, grants will be awarded to proposals not 
only in order of ranking but at least also to one proposal that is the highest 
ranked within the area of shallow & low/mid enthalpy geothermal (0-500 
m depth and temperature below 150ºC) and at least also to one proposal 
that is the highest ranked within the area of deep & high enthalpy 
geothermal ( above 500 m depth and temperature above 150ºC), provided 
that proposals attain all thresholds (and subject to available budget). This 
condition to ensure a balanced portfolio will also be considered to be met 
if a proposal addressing both areas is funded.  
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Developers and energy providers benefit from de-risking and cost reduction of 
geothermal resource development; 
• Citizens benefit from energy efficient, sustainable, generation of electricity, direct heat, 
and/or heating and cooling from geothermal resources in a wide range of geological 
settings; 
• Technology leadership, competitiveness, and technology export potential of European 
industry in the geothermal energy supply chain are increased; 
• The technological innovation is environmentally sound, aligned with societal values, 
norms and behavioural aspects of end users and actors across the whole geothermal 
value chain, improving energy justice and citizenship.   

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 110 of 313 
Scope: Proposals should focus on the demonstration of innovative approaches to resource 
development in: (i) the area of shallow & low/mid enthalpy geothermal (0-500 meter-depth 
and temperature below 150ºC) and/or (ii) in the area of deep & high enthalpy geothermal 
(beyond 500 meter-depth and temperature above 150ºC). Proposals should also expressly 
identify whether they are addressing the area of (i) shallow geothermal; (ii) deep geothermal; 
or (iii) both shallow and deep geothermal. 
Drilling and subsurface engineering account for a large part of the costs of geothermal 
projects, and on-field project development contains significant risks due to inherent 
geological uncertainties. Reducing costs upfront, improving performance, estimating 
uncertainty, and reducing risk can therefore boost the geothermal capacity deployment rate. 
The scope covers advances beyond the state of the art in one/several of the following points: 
• subsurface engineering; 
• well design, drilling and completion; 
• reservoir characterisation and development planning.  
Proposals should include one or more of the following: robot and AI-physics-based 
simulation solutions for geothermal resource development, novel cost-efficient drilling 
methods and equipment, advanced drilling fluids, new materials for casing, cementing and 
completion, working fluids, logging while drilling, wireline technologies and geosteering high 
temperature electronics, well architecture and stimulation, closed loop technology, enhanced 
production pumps, and innovative monitoring systems during geothermal resources 
exploitation including their integration in digital twins. 
Proposals are expected to reduce project development time while ensuring safety of 
operations and adaptation to specific geothermal environments (including offshore), 
constraining and quantifying geological uncertainties, reducing field development and seismic 
risks. They can include standardisation of the drilling equipment enhanced well production, 
enhanced environmental performance, improve component resistance to corrosion, scaling, 
high temperature, wear, and mechanical failures, increase energy extraction. 
The project must include a clear go/no-go milestone ahead of entering the demonstration 
phase of the project. Before this go/no-go milestone, delivery of the detailed engineering 
plans, a techno-economic assessment, and all needed permits for the demonstrator should be 
foreseen. The project proposal is expected to present a clear and convincing pathway and 
timeline to obtaining the permits. 
Environmental impact of the proposal should be assessed, and mitigation measures 
considered. 
Where relevant, the project is expected to follow FAIR data principles, adopt data quality 
standards, data integration operating procedures and GDPR-compliant data sharing/access 
good practices developed by the European research infrastructures.

In order to enhance the benefits of the technology, proposals are expected to develop 
understandings of how the utilisation of geothermal resources aligns with the cultural values 
and contextual settings at local to regional level and increase the responsiveness of 
geothermal energy to diverse societal interests and concerns. To achieve that, an inclusive, 
early and continuous societal engagement should be enhanced. 
In particular, this topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the 
involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise 
(applied to social innovation), in order to produce meaningful and significant effects 
enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.

Expected Outcome: For a renewables-based electricity system sufficiently flexible and also in 
the long-run highly sustainable hydropower capacity is pivotal. 
Project results are expected to contribute to some of the following expected outcomes, to the 
benefit of hydropower operators and technology providers:  
• Enhanced capacity and flexibility of the hydropower fleet to contribute to renewable 
energy systems and management of water flows; 
• Increased technology leadership, competitiveness, and technology export potential of the 
European hydropower industry; 
• Enhanced sustainability of hydropower with positive effects on river ecosystems and 
biodiversity, and considering adaptation to climate change; 
• Responsiveness to a deeper understanding of the needs and concerns of diverse social 
groups, citizens and civil society at large involved in or potentially affected by the R&I 
development, thereby increasing the potential for beneficial societal uptake and building 
trust in results and outcomes.   
Scope: Proposals are expected to develop hydropower technology solutions or improved 
water management schemes or a combination of both, which allow for synergies between 
flexible hydropower energy generation and local ecosystem management for existing run-of-
river hydropower or reservoir hydropower plants or cascades of such plants, which are 
connected to the grid. To achieve this objective, thematic areas like e.g., hydropeaking, 
floodplain biotopes, sediment transport and/or river morphology restoration and 
environmentally efficient water flows also considering effects of climate change, can be 
addressed. Societal needs and the participation of local communities in decision processes in 
view of trust building should be considered. 
Developed solutions are expected to enhance the flexibility of hydropower generation 
according to current and expected power grid needs and water availability, while being highly 
sustainable and creating positive impacts on river ecosystems and biodiversity, through e.g., 
equipment, material and digital innovation, nature-inclusive design, ecosystem restoration 
solutions, innovative and sustainable reservoir and water flow operation and management. 
Developed solution should not reduce the hydropower generation efficiency and equipment 
functionality while improving the environmental performances arising from this in a win-win 
optimisation. Respective impacts for both, energy and biodiversity should be assessed. 
Research and Innovation on pumped storage hydropower as well as on water management 
schemes not related to hydropower or not directly connected to natural water bodies is 
excluded from this topic. 
This topic is a Societal-Readiness pilot: 
• Proposals should follow the instructions applying to the Societal readiness pilot, as 
described in the introduction of the Horizon Europe Main Work Programme 2025 for 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 113 of 313 
Climate, Energy and Mobility. They entail the use of an interdisciplinary approach to 
deepening consideration and responsiveness of research and innovation activities to 
societal needs and concerns. 
• This topic requires effective contribution of the relevant SSH expertise, including the 
involvement of SSH experts in the consortium, to meaningfully support Societal 
Readiness. Specifically, SSH expertise is expected to facilitate the socio-technological 
interface and enable the design of project objectives with Societal Readiness related 
activities.

apply: 
To ensure a balanced portfolio, grants will be awarded to proposals not 
only in order of ranking but at least also to one proposal that is the highest 
ranked within the area of concentrated solar power (CSP) and at least also 
to one proposal that is the highest ranked within the area of solar thermal 
heat and/or cold, provided that proposals attain all thresholds (and subject 
to available budget). This condition to ensure a balanced portfolio will 
also be considered to be met if a proposal addressing both areas is funded. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to some of the following 
expected outcomes: 
• Significant reduction of LCOHS (Levelised Cost of Heat Storage) and/or LCOE 
(Levelised Cost of Energy); 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 114 of 313 
• Technology providers profit from successful demonstration and de-risking of thermal 
energy storage solutions that improve the dispatchability of solar thermal plants and/or 
systems; 
• Technology providers have improved access to financing through better understanding 
of the bankability of dispatchable solar thermal solutions; 
• Electricity grid operators have access to reliable options to cope with the increase in the 
share of variable-output renewables and reduce curtailments; 
• The execution of the solar thermal implementation plan of the Strategic Energy 
Technology Plan (SET Plan) is supported and facilitated; 
• The execution of the solar energy joint research and innovation agenda134 is supported 
and facilitated.   
Scope: Support will be given to the demonstration of innovative thermal energy storage 
solutions in the following areas: (i) concentrated solar power (CSP) and/or (ii) solar thermal 
heat and/or cold. 
The proposed solutions will have to achieve substantial improvements in terms of 
performance, cost-effectiveness and life span compared to the current state of the art. 
The project must include a clear go/no-go milestone ahead of entering the demonstration 
phase. Before this go/no-go milestone, the project must deliver the detailed engineering plans, 
a techno-economic assessment, and all needed permits for the demonstrator. The project 
proposal is expected to present a clear and convincing pathway and timeline to obtaining the 
permits. 
The project has to assess the sustainability of the proposed solutions in environmental and 
socio-economic terms. Furthermore, the Commission initiative for Safe and Sustainable by 
Design135 (SSbD) sets a framework for assessing the safety and sustainability of chemicals 
and materials which should be considered as a reference for project proposals.

• Develop and demonstrate innovative wind energy manufacturing technologies that allow 
for reduced energy and material consumption, increased circularity, lower costs and 
decreased pollution; 
• Develop and demonstrate automated and/or semi-automated manufacturing solutions 
that ensure high-quality products, high productivity, increase the lifetime and the 
reliability of wind energy systems; 
• Develop and demonstrate manufacturing solutions for wind energy technologies that 
allow for high production throughput, optimisation of logistics and transport of 
components and reduced impacts on the environment, cultural heritage, landscapes and 
people.  
The project could, for instance, support the development of innovative manufacturing 
solutions for onshore and/or offshore wind energy production, including airborne wind 
energy. It could focus on specific components of a wind energy system (e.g., blades, nacelles 
and towers, gearboxes, foundations, generators, floaters, mooring systems, anchors, kites, 
etc.). 
The project should analyse and report on the potential for standardisation of the solutions 
developed, as well as on possible connections with ongoing standardisation efforts. 
The project must include a clear go/no-go milestone ahead of entering the demonstration 
phase. Before this go/no-go milestone, the project must deliver the detailed engineering plans, 
a techno-economic assessment, and all needed permits for the demonstrator. The project 
proposal is expected to present a clear and convincing pathway and timeline to obtaining the 
permits. 
The project must assess the sustainability of the proposed solutions in environmental and 
socio-economic terms. 
The demonstration must be at a realistic, representative scale and must cover a continuous 
interval of at least six months. 
When developing improvements along the supply chain to improve the health and safety 
working conditions, projects must give special consideration to the gender dimension. 
Whenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, 
manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the 
plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such 
exploitation. The exploitation plan should include preliminary plans for scalability, 
commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible 
funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund).

• Develop and validate solutions to increase the reliability of wind energy systems and 
their components, thus ensuring security of supply and further reducing the 
environmental impacts; 
• Develop new methods, computational techniques and tools to analyse and predict the 
reliability of wind energy systems, considering the analysis of the failure modes of 
existing systems and including a focus on new analytical approaches, technologies and 
materials; 
• Develop new methods and tools for condition and health monitoring of wind energy 
systems and their components; 
• Develop and validate solutions to optimise the operation and maintenance of wind 
energy systems and their components, for example through improved scheduling and 
predictive maintenance, autonomous tools, robots and vehicles, semi-automated 
inspection methods or advanced repair methods; 
• Develop and validate new components to be incorporated in structures’ designs to 
improve the safety and efficiency on-site during maintenance activities in wind farms; 
• Develop and validate innovative digital tools to facilitate wind farm operation and 
maintenance, for instance through improved interoperability, decision-making support 
tools, condition and health monitoring techniques and innovative sensors, while ensuring 
increased cybersecurity and data sharing.  
The solutions proposed have to provide solid evidence to support the choice of the sub-
systems and components in focus. They have to be critical for the overall reliability of the 
wind energy systems. For instance, in the case of floating offshore wind, these could be 
dynamic cables, moorings and connection systems (electrical and mechanical) and their 
interaction with complex ocean flows. 
Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic 
is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable). 
Digitalisation plays a prominent role under various perspectives, for instance in terms of 
improved predictive maintenance activities and advanced sensors technologies for 
diagnostics, condition and health monitoring of the power electronics, and structural health 
assessment and monitoring. 
Projects should aim at reducing downtime and operational costs, enhancing safety protocols 
for maintenance crews, and increasing the overall lifespan and efficiency of wind energy 
assets. 
These solutions should be easily standardised and/or should take into account current 
standardisation efforts, notwithstanding the TRL level envisaged for the projects developed 
under this topic.

Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021-2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025). 138. 
 
Expected Outcome: The EU’s Offshore Strategy139 underlines that the deployment of offshore 
wind should be based on maritime spatial planning, assessing the economic, social, and 
environmental sustainability of the installations in a life-cycle perspective, while ensuring co-
existence with other activities such as commercial and recreational uses of the sea and fishing. 
At the same time, it calls for research on the cumulative impacts of offshore energy

generation on the environment, which was also underlined in the Communication on 
Delivering on the EU offshore renewable energy ambitions (2023)140. 
Our knowledge on such impacts, positive and negative, is more advanced now than when the 
Offshore Strategy was adopted141. However, there are still significant data and knowledge 
gaps. Most fieldwork studies have been carried out at very localised sites and often focused 
on specific species. These ad-hoc studies lead to conclusions that can hardly be generalised. A 
sound monitoring, measuring multiple pressures and impacts on ecosystems and their 
services, at wider scale and in interaction with other sea activities, is still largely missing. 
There is also a need to further develop models and other instruments for environmental risk 
assessment, identification of mitigation measures and recommendations for restoration 
measures, considering impacts during construction, operation and maintenance, repowering 
and decommissioning. 
Improving instruments, data, and knowledge on the cumulative environmental impacts of 
offshore energy, as well as a sound monitoring, is key to ensure that its expected fast and 
large-scale deployment will be sustainable. It will also better equip the EU to contribute to 
mitigate such impacts and promote sustainable deployment of offshore wind at regional (e.g., 
through OSPAR142 in the Northeast Atlantic) or subregional (e.g., through the Greater North 
Sea basin Initiative) level. 
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: 
• The scientific community, public authorities, project designers, permitting authorities, 
civil society organisations and citizens have better tools (including Maritime Spatial 
Planning tools), reliable data and knowledge to monitor, assess and minimise the 
cumulative environmental, including on biodiversity, and socio-ecological impacts of 
large-scale bottom-fixed and floating offshore wind energy generation, including at sea-
basin level and when combined with other planned or existing human activities; 
• The monitoring of cumulative environmental impacts, including on biodiversity, of 
offshore wind installations is improved, with better tools and open data, in a coherent 
scheme with pre-existing monitoring programs of the marine environment at large scale; 
• Ambitious national and regional offshore wind deployment targets are achieved with 
positive or minimum negative impacts on the marine and coastal environment; 
• Deploy offshore wind energy with minimal impact on marine and coastal ecosystems, 
and, if possible, with net-positive ones.   
Scope: Proposals are expected to address at least five of the following aspects:

• Provide better knowledge and understanding of the cumulative environmental impacts of 
the offshore wind energy deployment according to the EU targets, when added to the 
current and planned human activities carried out in the same areas; 
• Expand existing studies, field monitoring, and analysis from local to larger areas, and 
from site- or species-specific impacts to more general ones. Further develop and deploy 
field monitoring activities, measuring multiple pressures and impacts on marine and 
coastal ecosystems and their services, as well as pollution, from installation to 
decommissioning and possible repowering, including operational phase and maintenance 
activities; 
• Test and demonstrate field monitoring and modelling technologies that allow to go 
beyond state-of-knowledge, regarding life-cycle environmental impacts of offshore wind 
energy deployments; 
• Improve instruments and models for Maritime Spatial Planning, and environmental 
assessments at plan and project level that are in alignment with public authorities’ needs; 
• Improve modelling capacity and environmental impact assessments of future offshore 
wind deployment; 
• Support the identification of areas where wind energy deployment is particularly suitable 
without significant environmental impact and areas where on the contrary, it should be 
avoided; 
• Identify strategies, test, and demonstrate technologies that avoid, minimise, mitigate and 
compensate the environmental impact of bottom-fixed and floating offshore wind energy 
systems, propose mitigation and restoration measures and if feasible, provide net-
positive environmental impacts.  The activities carried out under this point are expected 
to achieve TRL 5 by the end of the project.   
Particular attention must be dedicated to ensuring that the data produced in the context of this 
topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable) and to leveraging existing 
community practices for data sharing especially those in the relevant European common data 
spaces and in the European Research infrastructures. 
Complementarities with other ongoing and upcoming Horizon Europe projects are expected to 
be ensured as well as with the European Digital Twin of Ocean (European DTO) and its core 
infrastructure, for instance the projects funded under topics: 
• HORIZON-CL6-2025-02-CLIMATE-02: The ocean-climate-biodiversity-people nexus: 
uncovering safe operating space for safeguarding the integrity and health of the global 
ocean; 
• HORIZON-MISS-2025-03-OCEAN-08: EU Digital Twin Ocean: Contribution to the 
EU DTO core infrastructure through applications for sustainable ocean management;

Digital Twin Ocean; 
• HORIZON-CL5-2024-D3-02-08 Minimisation of environmental, and optimisation of 
socio-economic impacts in the deployment, operation and decommissioning of offshore 
wind farms.   
In addition to considering the most evident environmental impacts of offshore wind energy 
systems (displacement, collision risk, exposure to aerial and underwater noise, habitat loss 
and degradation, pollution, etc.), funded projects must include an analysis of possible new 
impacts, that may become particularly relevant when a high number of wind energy systems 
is deployed, for instance in relation to the decommissioning and removal of end-of-life 
offshore wind energy systems, the presence of dynamic cables suspended in the water 
column, the impact of submarine geohazards on the dynamic cables or the production of 
microplastics. 
Environmental monitoring data must be open source and be shared with the European Marine 
Observation and Data Network (EMODnet) and the International Energy Agency Wind 
Energy Systems Technology Collaboration Programme’s (IEA Wind TCP) Task on the 
environmental effects of wind energy.

Expected Outcome: The majority of commercially available photovoltaic (PV) solar cells 
produced worldwide are made of crystalline silicon. Material quality, process technologies, 
and solar cell architectures have improved significantly in recent decades, and solar cell 
efficiencies are now approaching 27%, thus close to the theoretical limit. However, challenges 
remain in several aspects, such as increasing the production yield, stability, reliability, cost, 
and sustainability. 
The ingot and wafering production steps are power intensive and produce recyclable waste in 
the form of kerf slurry – the residue ingot material from between the sliced wafers. These 
production steps are highly concentrated in China. 
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: 
• A European economic base which is stronger, more resilient, competitive, and fit for the 
green and digital transitions, by reducing environmental impact and strategic 
dependencies for critical raw materials and components; 
• Scaling-up solar PV manufacturing capacity in Europe for an accelerated solar PV 
deployment, supporting Europe’s decarbonisation targets; 
• Reduced energy and material consumption and lower carbon and environmental 
footprint for crystalline silicon PV products along their lifecycle; 
• The execution of the solar energy joint research and innovation agenda144.   
Scope: Due to their efficiency and durability, crystalline silicon wafers are by far the most 
common absorber material used in the production of solar cells and modules today. These 
wafers are primarily made using either a directional solidification that produces large-grained 
multi-crystalline (mc-Si) wafers with a greater defect density (and therefore almost out of 
production) or a solar-optimised Czochralski (Cz) growing method that produces crystalline 
silicon with low defect density (c-Si). In addition, “kerfless” silicon wafers can be grown 
directly either from molten silicon or from gaseous epitaxial deposition on a low-cost 
substrate at high temperature. To facilitate continued and rapid proliferation of Si 
photovoltaics, realizing new, more efficient and less energy and material intensive processes 
for silicon feedstock, ingots and wafers is sought. Therefore, proposals are expected to 
address at least one of the following challenges:

• Demonstrate alternative, efficient, and scalable (towards gigawatt capacity) processes or 
methods and equipment to grow silicon ingots and wafers from either liquid or gaseous 
phase at lower cost (with lower energy and material requirements) and high-quality 
compared to standard processes and possibly avoid the wafering step; 
• Optimise standard processes and equipment for defect, impurities and structure loss 
minimisation, high-quality ingots with large diameters (for larger wafers) that allow for 
higher level of automation and kerf recycling and/or use of recycled silicon from waste 
solar modules and reduced energy use; optimise wafering.  
Proposals are expected to involve multidisciplinary consortia including at least one silicon 
ingot and wafer manufacturer. 
Whenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, 
manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the

Expected Outcome: The rapid development of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) over the past 
decade makes it the most promising next generation photovoltaic technology, owing to its 
prominent advantages such as tuneable bandgap, high absorption coefficients, uncomplicated 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025

Part 8 - Page 125 of 313 
preparation process and considerable power conversion efficiency which has reached a 
certified 26.7% at cell level. Tremendous efforts in material and device engineering have also 
increased moisture, heat, and light-related stability. All these features render perovskite solar 
modules suitable for terawatt-scale energy production with a low levelised cost of electricity 
(LCOE). A number of companies are working on PSCs and some of them, have been 
establishing new pilot production lines and/or expanding production capacity. Still, the 
greatest challenges toward commercialisation are scaling up (including ambient 
manufacturing), achieving long-term stability, reducing, or eliminating the use of toxic 
solvents, and preventing Pb leakage into the environment. 
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: 
• Increase the potential for commercialisation of perovskite PV creating competitive 
technological know-how for the European PV industrial base; 
• Support a European economic base which is stronger, more resilient, competitive, and fit 
for the green and digital transitions, by reducing strategic dependencies for critical raw 
materials and components; 
• Support the execution of the solar energy joint research and innovation agenda145.   
Scope: Metal halide perovskite solar cells have attracted much attention because of their low-
cost fabrication and high efficiency. In addition, tandem devices, especially perovskite-Si 
tandems, are expected to play an important role in perovskite commercialisation. Poor 
stability of these devices remains however the key challenge in their path toward 
commercialisation. To overcome this issue, a robust encapsulation technique by employing 
suitable materials and structures with high barrier performance against the external 
environment must be developed to protect perovskite devices. Dedicated manufacturing 
processes and equipment need also be demonstrated. Therefore, proposals are expected to 
address all of the following aspects: 
• Demonstrate effective strategies to enhance the optoelectronic properties, performance 
and stability, and minimise the environmental impact of perovskite devices; 
• Scale-up reliable deposition of high-quality perovskite films over large areas, 
(overcoming the degradation of efficiency as device/module areas scale up) but also 
patterning and interconnections to connect individual cells into modules; 
• Demonstrate internal and external encapsulation structures as protection from extrinsic 
environmental stressors, such as moisture, oxygen, heat, and illumination; 
• Develop module designs considering recyclability requirements and restrictions as to the 
control and management of toxic Pb2+ that could be produced by the irreversible 
deterioration of the perovskite materials;

• Assess performance and reliability according to international standards and compared 
with well-established PV technologies; develop and apply test protocols for performance 
and reliability tailored to the features of perovskite and/or perovskite-Si tandem 
technology. 
• Demonstrate suitable equipment adapted to the specific requirements of perovskite (or 
perovskite-Si tandem) production process.

Expected Outcome: Integrating renewable and distributed energy resources, such as 
photovoltaics (PV) and energy storage devices, into the electric distribution system requires 
advanced power electronics, or smart inverters, that can provide grid services such as voltage 
and frequency regulation, ride-through capabilities, dynamic current injection, and anti-
islanding functionality. To enable this integration, designing novel smart inverter 
technologies, developing robust control algorithms for better inverter functionality, 
determining interactions between multiple smart inverters and between inverters and utility 
distribution systems, supporting standards development for smart inverter functionalities, and 
analysing the impacts of smart inverters on distribution systems is necessary. 
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: 
• Energy yield improvement of PV systems based on smart digitalisation; 
• Optimal utilisation of generated energy, energy savings, and enhanced overall energy 
efficiency; 
• Enhanced flexibility services and interoperability; 
• The execution of the solar energy joint research and innovation agenda147.   
Scope: Proposals are expected to: 
• Demonstrate new inverter technologies with increased power density and reliability at 
lower cost (e.g., allowing for medium voltage PV systems), that integrate new power 
device technologies based on wide bandgap semiconductors (e.g., GaN, SiC) that could 
supply synthetic inertia and a range of grid services; 
• Design of smart (e.g., integrating condition and health monitoring), and with improved 
capabilities, inverter hardware and firmware;

Expected Outcome: Photovoltaic (PV) energy systems are one of the cheapest and fastest 
growing sources of electricity generation, largely thanks to an important decrease in the cost 
of solar modules in the last 10-15 years, and to their simple installation. The PV market is 
changing fast, recently transitioning to high-efficiency crystalline silicon cell concepts (e.g., 
Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (TOPCon), Heterojunction (HJT), Interdigitated Back 
Contact (IBC), tandem, etc.), larger modules or novel designs (e.g., bifacial), use of new 
materials (e.g., anti-reflection and anti-soiling coatings, thinner glass, new encapsulants and 
backsheets), or increased number and topology of busbars or wires. There is no PV lifetime 
definition, but manufacturers usually guarantee a 25-year lifetime with an expected 
degradation rate of 0.8% per year. However, abnormal degradation rates are still reported for 
cell and module technologies due to a variety of failures which reduce reliability and increase 
the cost of PV systems operation. 
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: 
• Reduced degradation to levels that enable longer PV module lifetimes; 
• Increased module durability and reliability; 
• Resource efficiency and lifelong energy yield improvement of PV systems; 
• Decreased levelised cost of electricity (LCOE); 
• Execution of the solar energy joint research and innovation agenda149.   
Scope: The degradation rate might vary depending on many factors such as material 
properties, environmental stress (solar irradiance, humidity, temperature, wind speed, dust, 
etc.), installation, design and type of components and connections, with some components 
deteriorating on their own and others impacting additional PV components, leading to more 
severe failures. To tackle these issues and extend the lifetime of PV modules (and systems) 
proposals are expected to: 
• Identify defects and failure modes encountered in recently developed high-efficiency or 
novel design c-silicon modules themselves and their components, exploring their 
mechanisms and root causes, reviewing each component’s susceptibility to defects and 
failures and impacting additional PV components;

biodiversity, and socio-economic (both positive and negative) impacts of the wave 
energy technologies along their lifecycle and value chains; 
• Wave energy technology providers have detailed analysis of current costs and potential 
future energy cost reduction pathways and the creation of a detailed business plan for 
full scale commercialisation resulting in a clear path for commercial roll-out of the 
successful wave energy design(s) beyond the lifetime of the project; 
• Funding authorities pool resources at national and EU levels dedicated to Research and 
Development and provide effectively a significant developmental boost of wave energy 
technology.   
Scope: The challenge is the development and demonstration of cost-effective wave energy 
converters that can survive in a harsh and unpredictable ocean or sea environment through 
demand-driven pre-commercial procurement (PCP). The challenge is open to proposals 
seeking to steer wave energy development in an effective way at a European level and to 
bring these technologies to the market. 
The operation of wave energy prototypes in real sea conditions is a critical step to establish 
confidence in the devices and to facilitate the large-scale roll-out of this renewable 
technology. Pre-commercial procurement has been shown to be an effective tool to de-risk 
such activities. 
The EuropeWave PCP action has introduced the ocean energy stage-gate process on a 
European-level procedure following the evaluation framework provided by Task 12 of the 
IEA Ocean Energy System Technology Collaboration Platform. It supported the development 
of several wave energy devices in a stage-gate process to Stage 3 (approximately TRL 6). The 
scope of this action is to bring wave energy technologies at Stage 4 approximately TRL7/8). 
Designs must achieve completion of Stage 4 activities of the IEA-OES Framework Evaluation 
Areas by the end of the action, including technical, socio-economic, and sustainability 
aspects.  
Proposals have to describe their jointly identified challenge, indicating how it fits into their 
mid-to-long term innovation plans, and specify why solutions currently available on the 
market or under development are not meeting their needs. 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 132 of 313 
Activities have to include: (1) networking related to preparation, management and 
coordination and (2) joint research activities related to the validation of PCP strategy. The 
consortium should include at least three legal entities established in different member states or 
Horizon Europe associated countries, as well as a minimum of two 'public procurers'. Other 
entities with a clear added value in the preparation and/or execution of the PCP or in 
coordination and networking activities might be considered. 
The proposed action is to be structured as following: 
Preparation phase:  
Participating users/buyers of R&D services (with either a pan-European, national, or regional 
focus) should agree on a common set of performance levels and associated specifications for 
wave energy systems. The funding from the participating users/buyers and the European 
Union will be used to bring forward wave energy technologies and complete Stage 4 (reach 
TRL7/8).  
The procurement is open to any entities established in the EU or countries associated to 
Horizon Europe, and the proposed wave energy technology must be able to evidence the 
satisfactory completion of stage 3 activities as a minimum prior-development requirement 
(with or without the support of EuropeWave). A phased approach can be considered to allow 
developers to qualify for selection for the Stage 4 demonstration. Demonstrators don’t have to 
be necessarily tested at the same site. 
At the end of the preparation phase, the following results are expected: i) completed tender 
documents, ii) signed joint procurement agreement confirming the collaboration modus 
operandi including the financial commitment of the buyers’ group and iii) final confirmation 
of the lead procurer. 
Execution phase:  
This phase will take care of implementing the PCP and its contracts. 
The procurement will be executed as a single joint procedure in which different lots can be 
considered. The research and specification works are expected to lead to at least two 
commercial scale demonstrators tested for at least 12 months in a commercially representative 
site during the action duration following the IEA-OES150 stage-gate metrics.  
Results will be shared with the European industry to accelerate the technology development 
and the establishment of guidelines and standards to facilitate the transferability of knowledge 
creation. At the end of the action, at least one of the demonstrators is expected to be ready for 
testing in an operational environment at commercial scale.  
At the end of the action, designs are expected to be ready to proceed to Stage 5 activities of 
the IEA-OES Framework Evaluation Areas (Commercial-scale array demonstration).

Expected Outcome: The development of research and innovation policies, as well as general 
energy policies in the area of smart and integrated energy systems require a sound evidence 
base. The BRIDGE157 initiative established by the European Commission brings together 
projects funded under the Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe programmes in the areas of 
Smart Grids, Energy Storage, Islands, and Digitalisation. BRIDGE has a twofold objective. 
On the one hand, it fosters the exchange of information, experience, knowledge, and best 
practices among the projects. On the other hand, it provides field experience, feedback and 
lessons learned from the participating projects to help overcome the barriers to effective 
innovation. It aims at gathering coordinated, balanced and coherent recommendations 
presented with a single voice to policy makers, in view of successfully supporting research 
and innovation actions, and exploiting the results achieved by projects. 
Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes: 
• European research and innovation policies, and energy policies in the areas of smart 
energy systems are supported by evidence gathered from the implementation of real-life 
projects. 
• Projects funded under Horizon Europe that address energy systems are informed on 
solutions and methodologies that were previously developed by European-funded 
projects and are effectively benchmarking their results and compare lessons learnt with 
other similar European projects. 
• Consolidation of the BRIDGE initiative and re-affirmation of its role as a recognised 
European reference for providing innovative solutions for the development of smart and 
integrated energy systems. 
• Effective and improved cooperation of BRIDGE with other European initiatives that are 
active in related areas (such as ETIP SNET158).   
Scope: Proposals are expected to: 
• Provide professional support to the overall organisation of the BRIDGE initiative, its 
working groups and task forces. This includes organisational and logistical support for 
the governance of BRIDGE, e.g. for the preparation and execution of meetings and 
support to the activities of coordination with other EU and/or national initiatives and 
bodies. It also includes support to the chairs of the working group chairs in fulfilling 
their roles and facilitating the periodic processes for the renewal of the chairmanship. 
• Onboard new projects and maintain the database of BRIDGE members in terms of 
projects, implementing organisations/project partners, their membership in Working 
Groups and Task Forces, contact details.

• Ensure the completion and publication of the relevant reports, studies, brochures, policy 
briefings etc. Three main categories of documents are envisaged:        
1. BRIDGE annual brochures159 – are prepared by the project, updated annually and 
published online;     
2. Annual 
thematic/expert 
reports
160  containing 
policy 
conclusions 
and 
recommendations – are drafted by the BRIDGE working groups under the 
coordination of their chairmanship, as decided in their annual work programmes. 
The project ensures final editorial support and formatting, and their publication 
online;     
3. Other reports, as needed and decided by the Bridge chairmanship on a case-by-case 
basis.    
• Maintain the online presence of BRIDGE and ensure the related communication 
activities, notably through maintaining and developing its dedicated web page, 
distributing a periodic (online) newsletter, and posts on social media. 
• Enable BRIDGE to provide policy support to the European Commission services 
(mainly to DG Energy) by gathering, structuring and presenting information on 
technological progress, innovation, competitiveness and digitalisation in the field of 
smart energy systems. 
• Organise the annual BRIDGE General Assemblies, including invitations, hosting, 
minutes/conclusion drafting and follow up on action points. The meetings usually take 
place in March, usually face-to-face in Brussels with hybrid options available. 
• Manage cooperation with other relevant European initiatives, notably with the European 
Technology and Innovation Platform - Smart Networks for Energy Transition (ETIP 
SNET). Manage the representation of BRIDGE and its member projects at key events 
(e.g., European Sustainable Energy Week, established European fairs such as Enlit – to 
be decided on a case-by-case basis etc.).   
Proposals submitted under this topic are encouraged to include actions designed to facilitate 
cooperation, across Europe, with other initiatives and to ensure the accessibility and 
reusability of data produced during the project. 
The indicative project duration is three years.

Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Improved preparedness of the electricity system to support the EU's binding target for 
2030 of minimum 42.5% renewables in gross final energy consumption, with the 
aspiration to reach 45%; 
• Grid operators employ improved tools for forecasting energy generation from renewable 
sources and energy demand; 
• Grid operators employ innovative energy management systems and technologies for 
smart grids to operate efficiently the integration of RES at various voltage levels; 
• Transmission and distribution system operators develop better capacity for exploiting 
system flexibility and accessing services for demand response and energy storage; 
• System operators develop structured mechanisms to cooperate with energy suppliers and 
service providers when required by grid conditions; 
• Transmission and distribution system operators cooperate and develop mechanisms to 
reduce system risks associated with increased fluctuating generation.   
Scope: Projects are expected to: 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 141 of 313 
• Design and test innovative technologies, processes, and control mechanisms for the 
seamless integration of massive volumes of renewable energy sources (RES) at 
distribution and transmission levels. The solutions are expected to incorporate both 
hardware and software aspects; 
• Address network constraints and increase flexibility capabilities of grids, through 
advanced operation and control mechanisms and tools, for improving the overall grid 
performance and the efficiency of RES uptake; 
• Ensure effective coordination between transmission and distribution levels of the 
electricity grids, for the integration of massive volumes of RES at multiple voltage 
levels, maintaining grid stability and overall preparing for a RES-based energy system.  
The demonstration, test and validation of the activities should be carried out in at least two 
pilots in different EU Member States and Associated Countries. 
Proposals should demonstrate a clear understanding of the challenges and opportunities 
associated with integrating renewable energy sources into the existing energy system. 
Building on this, they should demonstrate a comprehensive approach for developing and 
testing advanced technologies and control mechanisms that can effectively address these 
challenges, while capitalising on solutions for digitalising the energy system. 
In addition, projects should propose a set of best practices and recommendations on the 
effective uptake of increased shares of renewables. This should be suitable for a level of 
renewables in the electricity system that would allow reaching the EU's binding renewable 
target for 2030 of minimum of 42.5% (with the aspiration to reach 45%). 
Projects are expected to include at least two electricity transmission system operators (TSOs) 
and four distribution system operators (DSOs), which could be distributed among the pilots of 
a particular project. 
Additionally, collaboration is encouraged with the following entities: 
• at least three suppliers of energy from renewable sources, out of which at least two 
should supply energy from non-dispatchable energy sources. The supply covered by the 
project should include both wind and solar energy sources; 
• at least two providers of energy services for the grids (e.g., aggregation of energy supply 
and/or energy demand, energy storage).  
This collaboration (minimum number of entities) is sought per project in total and does not 
necessarily apply per each pilot in particular. 
Selected projects are expected to contribute to the BRIDGE initiative 161  and actively 
participate in its activities.

Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Improved observability, monitoring and control of the electricity distribution grids; 
• Optimised management (including maintenance) of the grids by system operators and 
improved system resilience (including withstanding natural hazards and cybersecurity 
incidents);

assisted by artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, if applicable; 
• A 'smart substation ecosystem’ is created that includes distribution system operators, 
technology/solution providers, integrators, application developers etc. This should cover 
both high-to-medium and medium-to-low voltage levels.   
Scope: Projects are expected to: 
• Demonstrate the integration of power electronics, intelligent electronic devices (IEDs), 
and software solutions in the distribution substations or in their proximity; 
• Demonstrate real-time monitoring and analysis of grid conditions (including power 
quality, voltage levels, grid component monitoring, and overall system performance) that 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 143 of 313 
allow operators to quickly identify and address any potential issues or disturbances, help 
to prevent outages and minimise the impact of service disruptions; 
• Consolidate data streams from otherwise dispersed sources to create unified 
visualisations and consolidated analytics that offer insights into the performance of 
distributions substations; 
• Develop the concept of a flexible and programmable electricity distribution grid in 
which the substation is a centre of intelligence that facilitates optimal power routing 
while ensuring the resilience of the electricity grid.  
The demonstration, test and validation of the activities should be carried out in at least two 
pilots in different EU Member States and/or Associated Countries. 
The projects should propose a set of best practices and recommendations on effective 
overarching principles and operational measures for: (i) building smart distribution 
substations, and (ii) integrating them into a more resilient, intelligent, and responsive 
distribution grid which is able to tackle disturbances and address net congestion. 
Projects are expected to include at least five distribution system operators (DSOs) operating 
across different geographies and climate conditions. This total number of DSOs per project 
could be distributed across the different pilots of a particular project.

Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Availability of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools for electricity system 
operators, energy service providers, and households and energy communities to enhance 
digital and green transformation in energy, mobility, and buildings; 
• Implementation of decentralised IT solutions based on generative AI to support local 
grid optimisation, thereby increasing the uptake of renewable energy sources, electric 
vehicles, and electrification of household and industrial demand at the distribution level; 
• Increased reliability, resilience, security, and energy efficiency of the energy system 
through advanced AI and digital tools; 
• Enhanced knowledge for modernising and operating energy networks, integrating digital 
services, renewables, and electrification through the use of cutting-edge AI technologies; 
• Development of smarter demand-side tools for industries and consumers, leveraging AI 
to optimise energy production and consumption.   
Scope: To achieve the Green Deal objectives for 2030 and 2050, substantial investments are 
required in a smart and digitally enabled energy system capable of integrating higher shares of 
renewable energy and electrification of demand and electricity storage. This encompasses 
various sectors such as transport (notably electric vehicles), industry (heating and hydrogen 
production) and residential heating. 
Effective smart planning, operation and control of the electricity grid and numerous 
distributed devices – including smart electricity meters, smart bi-directional charging 
networks for electric vehicles, and smart building platforms – are essential. These efforts must 
be underpinned by markets for flexibility and demand response, along with seamless data 
exchange between actors and devices. 
On-going innovation in the energy data space, smart Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, and 
digital twins for energy systems, coupled with energy price and market considerations, 
provide the foundation for advanced energy system intelligence. This intelligence will be 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025

further enhanced by leveraging generative artificial intelligence and the emerging AI 
Factories163. 
The scope is to develop and pilot prototypes of a generative AI-powered digital spine164 that 
enhances the digitalisation and decarbonisation of the EU energy system. 
The overall scope is the development of a prototype of an automated, AI-powered, software-
defined smart energy system leveraging and further developing existing (open-source) digital 
solutions of lower TRLs developed in EU and national research, innovation- and deployment-
programmes, as well as AI algorithms and tools provided by the AI Factories, namely to: 
• Develop and test the potential for generative AI to develop apps/programmes for local 
system optimisation and for system planning and operation; 
• Develop and test generative AI that can identify sources of flexibility and provide 
solutions for interoperability and data exchange to enable decentralised optimisation of 
distributed assets. This includes the integration with various data sources and sectors, 
such as mobility, to promote decentralisation, energy-efficiency, and cost-efficiency and 
to enable interoperability across different parts of the energy system; 
• Explore the potential of generative AI for system optimisation through scenario 
generation, simulation, and time series forecasting, while also developing optimisation 
tools for both supply-side and demand-side management using forecasts and data for 
renewable energy, transmission assets, storage, and energy-saving applications for 
consumers; 
• Propose tools and control systems to apply generative AI solutions developed in a high-
risk use-case (as defined in the AI act).  
The developed solutions should be dynamic, flexible, offering reconfigurable automated 
management, control and data exchange to ensure seamless operations across decentralised a 
setting. 
Projects are expected to: 
• Demonstrate AI-powered energy services, tools for power system planning and 
operation, and smart grid functionalities, such as flexibility, and electric vehicle (EV) 
charging as well as possibly transmission system operation across at least three EU 
member states and/or associated countries to enhance demand flexibility and drive 
innovative capabilities for decarbonisation and energy efficiency; 
• Indicate which generative AI basic tools, including available tools from the AI Factories, 
will be used and demonstrate how energy sector users will be involved in the

Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Integration of home and building assets in an efficient way based on common Internet of 
Things (IoT) communication standards for smart homes and using SGAM architecture 
and data models (e.g., IEC CIM) for load, generation and storage devices; 
• Facilitate local energy trading and distributed grid-oriented services using micro market 
and transactions (e.g., peer-to-peer) and improve the market participation for citizens; 
• Enhance the integration of energy communities in European energy grids and increase 
the renewable energy share and use of flexibility by providing transparent and efficient 
market-based cost sharing mechanisms; 
• Increase the security of data exchange, for prosumer and customer resources, and 
independent (commercial) asset operators; 
• Increase synergies using a cross-sectoral approach (e.g., electricity, gas, mobility, 
heating/cooling) at the level of citizens and/or energy communities; 
• Empower local governments and intermediaries, strengthen overall community energy 
policies in EU Member States and enhance tool accessibility and user capacity at local 
level to promote a decentralised and co-owned energy transition.   
Scope: The project should: 
• Develop innovative and open-source tools for managing shared energy community assets 
(e.g., energy storage facilities) and optimising energy community management (e.g., 
selection and switching of aggregators, preparation and trading of smart contracts, peer-
to-peer and energy sharing, self-consumption); 
• Develop open-source tools for forecasting, prediction and advanced data analysis using 
AI tools and in-depth data analysis for customers and prosumers for autonomous 
optimisation of consumption, production, storage, smart devices (appliances), and 
electric vehicle (EV) both at household and energy community levels; 
• Extend DSO SCADA and substation systems for autonomous control of grid assets and 
seamlessly integrate these systems with home and building energy management systems 
for direct and fast control and data acquisition to implement local (distribution) grid 
services (constrain alleviation, grid reconfiguration, restoration of supply, maintenance, 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 148 of 313 
and enhancement of energy quality), real-time assessment and monetisation of the use of 
grid resources; 
• Integrate the three elements above as a basis to establish a platform for cooperation 
between individual customers or prosumers, entire energy communities, wide area 
aggregators, and DSOs to provide, acquire, and settle energy system-oriented services 
(system-wide balancing, support of frequency regulation). The cooperation platform 
should be based on a plug-and-play integration of the energy community eco-system 
components (hardware and software), using and extending relevant communication 
standards and data models. The integration mechanism should be embedded within the 
core systems used by customers/prosumers, DSO (and TSO), aggregators and market 
operators, fully aligned with SGAM; 
• Develop tailored security solutions for private and public communication networks used 
by IoT apps and devices (smart appliances) across energy carriers; 
• Ensure the follow-up and implementation of EU policy measures, including by 
conducting quality assessments and introducing national community energy targets; 
• Foster institutional allies at local and regional levels; 
• Provide access to and capacities for using digital planning tools; 
• Identify the barriers for network operators (e.g. legal, economic, regulatory etc.) who 
want to introduce smart consumption options for their customers.  
Preferably semantically interoperable interactions, as enabled by the ETSI SAREF ontologies, 
are used. Furthermore, the project should follow the IEC TR 63097 Smart Grid Roadmap, and 
where relevant, the developed solutions should be open for off-shelf integration using 
common communication and data standards. 
The project should benefit from the direct participation of energy communities, smart 
appliances manufacturers, home energy devices manufacturers, home and building energy 
management system developers, Distribution System Operators (DSOs), and aggregators. 
However, in order to comply with Article 33, 36 and 54 of Directive (EU) 2019/944, TSOs or 
DSOs participating in this project should not own, develop, manage or operate energy storage 
facilities or recharging points for electric vehicles. Moreover, the role of the distribution 
system operator in facilitating peer to peer trading should be without prejudice to the rules in 
Article 35 Directive (EU) 2019/944. 
The developed solutions have to be tested within, at least, three energy communities from 
different European countries, preferably in regions with different socio-economic 
development contexts and different resource availabilities. Technical and social 
characteristics should be used in the project to validate the developed solutions' credibility. 
The demonstration sites should cover complex and technologically advanced energy 
communities, each located within the range of neighbouring secondary substations supplying 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 149 of 313 
a variety of customers/prosumers with close-to-autarky local energy generation, a range of 
energy vectors, a significant share of storage facilities, and flexible topology already available 
or to be achieved as an integral part of the project. The secondary substation should be already 
equipped with advanced monitoring and control systems. 
In order to increase the replication potential of the deployed solutions the three energy 
communities are invited to closely collaborate with similar energy communities. 
The selected projects are expected to contribute to the BRIDGE initiative and actively 
participate in its activities. Additional contributions to the ‘Alliance for Internet of Things 
Innovation’ (AIOTI) and other relevant activities (e.g., clusters of digital projects and 
coordinating actions) might be considered when relevant. 
In particular, this topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the 
involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in 
order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the 
related research activities.

Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Energy system planners and operators will deliver advanced tools to better optimise 
overall system value of Long-Duration Energy Storage (LDES) for cross-regional 
networks and markets dominated by intermittent and stochastic renewable energy 
sources. 
• Optimised LDES integration in relevant grid locations will help energy system 
stakeholders to maximise total lifetime cost-benefit, improved grid-operation as well as 
avoided fossil fuel use and CO2 abatement, renewable energy balancing and reduced 
need for network reinforcement;  
• Finetuned business cases for revenue stacking for multiple services as well as detailed 
overview of marginal abatement costs of various technologies and their combinations 
across the participating regions will help operators, planners and investors to take the 
right long term strategic decisions concerning LDES integration in the energy system. 
• Cost effective decarbonisation and market revenue streams to improve LDES economics 
(e.g., nodal and locational pricing) will increase investors trust and therefore accelerate 
LDES roll out.   
Scope: The project will develop and test new, advanced, integrated models and tools for 
cross-regional networks and markets that are dominated by intermittent and stochastic 
renewable energy sources. This spatial-temporal model should be designed to create, analyse 
and optimize scenarios for strategically integrating, locating and dimensioning LDES (here 
defined as: >12h) for a future European energy system. 
The proposed solution will be tested under different scenarios in a relevant/operational 
environment. The project should be based on a complete understanding of existing operational 
systems in at least two adjacent regions (NUTS 2 or 3) – best represented in the form of a 
digital twin (or similar). Consortia should include the respective system operators, service 
providers, technology providers, potential financial actors and other relevant stakeholders. 
The project should produce practical, operationally useful knowledge on cross-regional 
strategies for combining a variety of clean flexibility LDES solutions/technologies and cross-
sector integration, focusing on the optimal combination of LDES with RES production sites, 
industrial complexes and districts (e.g. co-location and hybridisation), to support the grid.

This topic will analyse the overall system value of integration of LDES (>12h) in the energy 
system under different future decarbonisation pathways, assessing the impact on operation 
and planning of energy infrastructure costs as well as security of supply, system reliability and 
resiliency. 
The scope is to maximise the benefit of LDES integration within the context of system wide 
optimisation of long-term grid enhancement strategies. This encompasses relevant, validated 
historical data sets, visualisation, scenario analysis, model sensitivity analysis and data set 
optimisation, optimal use of previously developed models and digital twins, cyber security, 
use of open-source solutions and free licensing. 
The project is expected to identify technical and regulatory barriers, and propose possible 
recommendations and policy actions, to promote the best solutions tackling these barriers and 
support replication of the solutions.

Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes:  
• Advanced 
European 
innovative 
knowledge 
basis 
and 
increased 
technology 
competitiveness in the area thermal storage; 
• Improved security of the future European renewable-based energy system; 
• Contribution to the decarbonisation of cities and densely populated urban areas with high 
safety solutions; 
• Significant reduction of LCOHS (Levelised Cost of Heat Storage);  
• Local communities are engaged and their expectations are responded to.  
• Technology developers practice inclusive societal engagement which is early, 
continuous, and sensitive to the technical specificities (e.g. local resource, subsurface 
uncertainties) and social challenges (e.g. low public awareness) of underground thermal 
energy storage technologies in the context of densely populated urban areas.   
Scope: In scope are novel technologies, interfaces, design methods and organisational 
concepts that result in the most effective and sustainable use of subsurface space in dense 
urban areas by Underground Thermal Energy Storage (UTES) systems such as ATES, CTES 
and BTES. 
Proposals should consider the integration in the existing energy grids and interaction with 
other urban uses of the subsurface (e.g., subways, underground utilities, buildings), including 
energy geostructures of buildings, tunnels, slabs, energy sheet pile walls, etc., with potential 
geothermal heating, cooling, and sinks or storage opportunities. 
Proposals should address the uncertainties in the seasonal energy demand to increase the 
predictability of the required subsurface space, the interactions among systems for the sake of 
optimal use of subsurface and thermal efficiency. 
Projects are expected to deploy one or more demonstrators and can address, for example, one 
or more of the following exemplary areas:  
• Optimal utilisation of geothermal resources and thermal energy storage in urban settings, 
addressing high (above 70 degrees Celsius), medium (30-70 degrees Celsius) and/or low 
temperatures (10-30 degrees Celsius) and possible requirements for retrofitting of the 
building stock; 
• Subsurface models for a sustainable underground thermal storage and geothermal use in 
cities; 
• The integration of heat pumps, advanced thermal storage, and interface with district 
heating infrastructures to contribute to the thermal and power grid flexibility; 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 153 of 313 
• Studying the impact of subsurface urban heat islands (SUHI) on the potential of shallow 
geothermal energy use in cities, using, for instance, long-term subsurface monitoring 
networks, satellite monitoring and models; 
• Best practices strategies for subsurface land-use plans in European cities; well/borehole 
placement strategies; 
•  Mutual interaction of existing and future neighbouring UTES systems from 
geotechnical, energy, and regulatory point of view; 
• Management of energy grids on an urban scale and system optimisation thorough digital 
twins predicting operational, environmental and economic response, as well as the 
interaction between the storage system and the local grids, under different scenarios; 
• Creation of large (time and scale-wise) open multisensory datasets to foster heat energy 
storage at the European scale which should adhere to the FAIR data principles, adopt 
data quality standards, data integration operating procedures and GDPR-compliant data 
sharing/access good practices developed by the European research infrastructures, where 
relevant.  
• Use of advanced monitoring systems such as fibre optic sensors, satellite imagery, etc. 
for monitoring and early detection of adverse impact of UTES at a district scale level 
and providing measures to mitigate such effects.  
Consideration should be given to de-risking solutions, and dedicated support schemes that 
guide innovative energy storage technologies through to the commercialisation stage. The 
consortium should assess the current regulatory context and provide recommendations linked 
to the proposed solutions for shaping future needs (e.g., regulatory, standardisation, 
permitting). In addition, appropriate local community engagement initiatives as well as 
expectations and experiences of underground thermal storage infrastructures (and to what 
extent it varies in dense urban areas) should be explored. 
This topic requires citizens engagement and dialogue and the effective contribution of SSH 
disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of 
relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the 
societal impact of the related research activities and ensure the translation of innovation into 
real-life outputs.

• Contribution to strengthened European technology knowledge base on energy system 
security; 
• Solutions addressing key aspects improving the technological and cross-cutting value 
chain aspects for energy security of grid and/or storage technologies are developed; 
• Contribution to improved security of the future European renewables- based energy 
system as an important factor in its cost-effectiveness and therefore directly impacting 
European competitiveness; 
• Contribution to the creation of European technological leadership in the energy security 
field and creation of a knowledge base for European industrial competitiveness.   
Scope: Development of novel solutions, which address specifically critical aspects affecting 
the energy security of energy network and/or storage technologies in respect of uninterrupted 
and cost-effective access to energy. As energy security of the energy grid and safe storage of 
variable renewables is directly related to a cost-effective and sustainable European energy 
system and therefore essential to European competitiveness, not only energy security aspects 
of the grid and storage technologies as such, but also those related to their respective value 
chains need to be addressed. Proposals should focus on development of solutions for grid 
and/or storage technologies, which can highly improve their sustainability, resilience, and 
overall energy security performance in the European context in the long run. Proposals should 
take into consideration the results of the Study on clean energy R&I opportunities to ensure 
European energy security by targeting challenges of distinct energy value chains for 2030 and 
beyond169. 
Project should address precisely only one of the following areas: 
Area 1- Advanced tools to address cybersecurity risks to 1) energy system transmission and 
distribution and 2) renewables to storage and storage to energy network interface 
technologies; 
Area 2- Increasing circular economy processes, recycling, re-use or substitution of sustainably 
supplied critical materials and electronics for energy network and storage technologies; 
Area 3- Sustainability and public perception of energy network and storage technologies as a 
limiting factor for their required capacity build-up and efficient performance in a secure 
energy system (e.g., hydropower, CAES storage). 
Furthermore, a framework for decent working conditions, most notably essential skills, and 
efficient skills management within the overall energy network and storage system are 
essential for inclusivity and competitiveness of these systems. They should be addressed as an 
important transversal value chain component.

• New capture technologies (either from points sources or directly from air) should lead to 
reduced overall cost of capture, as well as lowest possible negative environmental 
impact, including water use.   
Scope: Development of new or emerging capture technologies with high potential for cost 
reduction. Proposals shall address capture of CO2 either from one of the following areas (and 
explicitly identify which is being covered):   
1. Point sources, or 
2. Directly from air (direct air capture, DAC).  
Depending on the capture routes chosen (e.g., solvents, sorbents, membranes, cryogenic, solid 
looping), examples of important issues to address include enhanced absorption/adsorption, 
improved kinetics and reduced energy use for CO2 capture and desorption, new materials with 
high selectivity for CO2 capture, flexibility of operation, modularisation and scale-up, space 
occupation, degradation and life span of capture materials, ability for retrofit, potential for 
heat integration, and solvent-induced corrosion. 
In particular for DAC, examples of important issues to address are novel sorbent or solvent 
materials that have higher CO2 capture capacities and longer-term stability in the presence of 
heat and air. For all proposals, minimisation of health and environmental impact must be 
addressed in the project also in view of future scaling up. The developed technologies should 
aim at delivering CO2 at the specifications required for transport and storage, with very low 
levels of impurities. 
For point-source capture, the technologies should address the performance profile and 
characteristic when operating under variable operating conditions such as load changes to 
maintain and as high as possible capture rate across the entire operating profile. Results from 
point-source capture should provide good matches between specific industrial application and 
capture technology while guaranteeing the quality and continuity of the industrial process. 
The use of the European Research Infrastructure for CO2 Capture, Utilisation, Transport and 
Storage ECCSEL is encouraged but not mandatory. 
In particular for DAC, international cooperation with participating countries of the Mission 
Innovation Carbon Dioxide Removal Mission171 is encouraged.

Expected Outcome: The design and safe operation of a CO2 transport and storage system 
represents specific challenges as it involves CO2 streams at different flow rates, pressures and 
states (liquid, gaseous, super critical, dissolved in water), and with different compositions and 
impurities. The presence of impurities will change the chemical and thermophysical 
properties with respect to a pure CO2 fluid. When CO2 is transported in pipelines at 
conditions close to its critical temperature and pressure, the impact of impurities on the 
thermophysical properties can become substantial. High levels of CO2 stream purity must be 
achieved to avoid two-phase flow during pipeline transportation. In addition, reactive 
impurities can form strong acids giving unacceptable corrosion of pipelines, tubings and 
ships, and can impact on injectivity, well integrity and seal integrity of geological storage 
sites. Directive 2009/31/EC regulates that CO2 streams, while they may contain incidental 
associated substances from the source, capture or injection process, the concentrations of 
these substances should be below levels that would adversely affect the integrity of the 
storage site or the relevant transport infrastructure and not pose a significant risk to the 
environment or human health. Member States should ensure that storage site operators only 
accept and inject CO2 streams if a risk assessment shows that these conditions are met.

Part 8 - Page 159 of 313 
The Communication on Industrial Carbon Management 173  underlines the need for pre-
normative research on the physical and chemical behaviour of impure CO2 in order to 
contribute to relevant guidelines and standardisation work. This was also emphasised in a 
report prepared by a stakeholder group on CO2 standards under the CCUS Forum174. 
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: 
• Contribution to an accurate understanding of the effects of impure (and possibly 
corrosive) CO2 flows along the transport network (in particular pipelines and shipping) 
or in the storage complex in line with Art. 12 of Directive 2009/31/EC, including any 
engineered or geological barriers to leakage in the near-well region; 
• Inform relevant guidelines and contribute to standardisation work through improved 
understanding of the physical and chemical behaviour of impure CO2.   
Scope: Based on the application chosen (either transport or storage), projects have to deliver: 
• Recommendations for design and operation of pipelines and/or ship offloading, 
including recommendations for public health and safety requirements and for protective 
and/or mitigating material and/or approaches and/or monitoring technology to avoid 
adverse effects on the integrity of the relevant transport infrastructure caused by 
impurities; 
• Recommendations for public health and safety requirements and for protective and/or 
mitigating material and/or approaches and/or monitoring technology to avoid adverse 
effects on the integrity of the storage complex; 
• Guidance and recommendations for technology providers, regulatory authorities, 
certification and standardisation bodies, and define and implement ambitious 
dissemination actions to promote the project results and support their uptake.  
Projects can address, for example, the following issues: 
• Transient flow modelling along the pipeline network and; 
• Combined thermodynamic and corrosion modelling to predict corrosion rates under 
different conditions; 
• Reactive transport and geochemical modelling of the storage reservoir in the near-well 
zone, including associated geological barriers to leakage; 
• Generation of experimental data on the geochemical reactions of reservoir rocks, 
caprocks, well cements and fault seals exposed to impure CO2 under the span of 
pressure and temperature regimes relevant for planned and future storage projects in

for mineral storage of CO2, to tune existing and/or new models; 
• Generation of experimental data on thermophysical and corrosive properties of CO2-rich 
mixtures under CCS-relevant conditions, to tune existing or new models; 
• Impact of impurities on various equipment (e.g., valves, gaskets, compressors, 
instrumentation), in particular on non-metallic components in the CO2 transportation 
system; 
• Impact of impurities on the physical behaviour and geochemical interaction of the CO2 
stream within the storage complex; 
• Impact of achieving very low impurity levels on the relative costs of competing capture 
technologies and the trade-off with costs for CO2 transportation and geological storage; 
• Development of a systematic method to understand limits for impurities and define 
specifications for transport and storage infrastructure.  
The use of the European Research Infrastructure for CO2 Capture, Utilisation, Transport and

Expected Outcome: The emergence of a Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) value chain in 
the European Union and Associated Countries is currently being hampered by a lack of a clear 
pathway to mature CO2 storage sites. In the Net Zero Industry Act regulation (NZIA), the EU 
has defined the objective that at least 50 million tonnes of CO2 per year can be stored 
geologically by 2030, in storage sites located in the territory of the European Union, its 
exclusive economic zones or on its continental shelf within the meaning of the United Nations 
Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and which are not combined with enhanced 
hydrocarbon recovery. There is a need to understand if current storage development is enough 
to meet EU storage requirements defined in the NZIA. 
Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcome: 
• Enhanced availability of CO2 storage sites and transparency about potential CO2 storage 
and injection capacity and infrastructure, including in relation to geomechanical 
characteristics and pressure interference from neighbouring storage projects, which can 
support market operators to plan their investments and enable the implementation of 
large-scale storage hubs connected to shared CO2 transport infrastructure.   
Scope: The project is expected to produce a digital atlas of ‘investable’ underground storage 
space for CO2 in the EU and Associated Countries. The European CO2 Storage Atlas177 
currently under revision and being updated by the GSEU project178, including estimated 
capacity and storage readiness level, presents a good basis, but also shows that data gaps need 
to be closed, and access to the necessary data during project implementation will be crucial. 
The Commission's Energy and Industry Geography Lab179 can also be used. Proposals are 
expected to include the following: 
• Identify and assess with a harmonised methodology, injection and storage capacities for 
current and planned projects and compare with storage requirements; 
• Identify key regions for future pre-licence appraisal (high estimated capacity, proximity 
to emitters, transport corridors), and develop plans for pre-licence appraisal, per region;

• Each potential storage site must be labelled according to its ‘storage readiness level’ in 
line with the storage readiness levels included in the GSEU atlas, and matched with 
public data to speed up the work to identify and assess the storage capacities and what is 
needed to mature understanding of the site. Furthermore, the identified potential storage 
sites should be compared and ranked by applying a common ranking scheme developed 
based on currently used ranking schemes and including a techno-economic assessment; 
• Environmental and security aspects must be taken into account.  
The proposal is expected to explicitly demonstrate the capacity to have access to the

and/or regional actors in the management of the subsurface, such as geological surveys or 
competent authorities, will be key.

Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Unlocking the economic potential of CO2 utilisation. Strengthening the industrial carbon 
management value chain through the delivery of innovative solutions for recycling CO2 
to produce advanced synthetic fuels, chemicals, polymers or minerals, making them 
price-competitive and accelerating their market deployment. 
• Contributing to emission reduction, energy security and autonomy of the EU through the 
gradual substitution of fossil-based feedstocks in the production of chemicals and 
materials by alternative feedstocks, like waste and residues, and captured CO2.   
Scope: Proposals must aim at reducing the capital intensity and energy and environmental 
footprint of CO2 conversion technologies to allow for upscaling in the short to medium term. 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025

In particular, proposals are expected to: 
• Provide information and assessment about the economic feasibility and the potential of 
scaling-up the proposed solutions at commercial scale as appropriate. 
• Reduce the use of virgin critical raw materials. 
• Define ambitious but achievable targets for energy requirements of the conversion 
process, production costs and product yields, as well of price competitiveness, that will 
be used to monitor project implementation. 
• Define minimum CO2 concentrations and maximum impurities levels that the 
conversion process can tolerate. Solutions that can cope with less pure CO2 streams will 
improve the overall energy efficiency. 
• Apply rigorous life-cycle analysis (LCA) to ensure that the proposed solution is 
comprehensively assessed on its ability to contribute to long-term sustainability: climate 
mitigation, adaptation, biodiversity, water use, pollution, and virgin resources depletion. 
The LCA must be in line with guidelines developed by the Commission, such as the 
Innovation Fund GHG methodology and the relevant ISO standards and the EU 
Taxonomy Regulation.   
Proposed solutions should focus on the CO2 conversion process, although integration in 
industrial capture or direct air capture facilities can be included. 
Enhanced oil, gas or coalbed methane recovery (EOR/EGR/ECBM) are out of scope of this 
topic. 
Whenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, 
manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the 
plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such 
exploitation and an analysis of equivalent final products in the market. The exploitation plans 
must include preliminary ideas for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility 
study, business plan, financial model) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially 
used (in particular the Innovation Fund).

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 166 of 313 
Scope: Buildings need to be sustainable and resource efficient, and the rate of deep renovation 
needs to be increased. This can be accelerated by modernising the construction sector and 
embracing the latest developments in robotics and automated systems. There is need for 
further research on innovative on-site robotic and other automated solutions and techniques 
that make renovation and construction works more sustainable, less disruptive, faster, as well 
as more accurate, cost effective and resource efficient. 
Proposals are expected to address all of the following: 
• Test and validate the use of innovative on-site robotic and automated solutions and 
techniques both for construction of buildings and for renovation of which at least one 
must investigate 3D printing; 
• Apply a research methodology which allows for a robust comparison of at least the three 
expected outcomes of the proposed innovative solutions and techniques with current best 
practices; 
• Investigate aspects of on-site workers’ safety and human-robot collaboration related to 
the future application of the proposed solutions and techniques; 
• Test and validate at least three prototype solutions and techniques to investigate their 
applicability for a variety of building typologies, duly justified to represent a relevant 
part of the European building stock. The prototypes should be validated in a lab or 
another relevant environment. Testing and validation must address solutions for both 
renovation and construction. The prototypes should be applicable either to renovation, or 
to construction, or to both, but both renovation and construction need to be addressed in 
a proposal.  
Selected proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint 
Research Centre (JRC) whose contribution could consist of providing added value regarding 
various aspects of on-site robotics for construction and renovation, as well as performing 
experimental research for validating full-scale prototype buildings renovated and/or 
constructed with robotic solutions.

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 168 of 313 
Scope: The construction sector and the building subsector remain among the least digitised. 
Smart buildings can contribute to reducing energy demand, curbing operational CO2 
emissions, integrating RES and enhancing grid flexibility through optimised energy usage. At 
the same time, it is essential that smart buildings are flexible and adaptive to changing needs 
and usage patterns and are user-friendly to encourage widespread adoption of these 
technologies by grid operators, construction professionals, building facility managers and 
users. Furthermore, to ensure the societal benefits of the smart building technologies there is a 
need for increased user knowledge, acceptance and satisfaction. 
Proposals are expected to address all of the following: 
• Develop solutions that enhance the smartness of buildings by using and facilitating the 
upgrade of existing Building (Energy) Management Systems (BMS/BEMS) and/or other 
technical equipment; 
• Ensure that the proposed solutions are user-friendly and provide the expected indoor 
environmental quality, as well as user satisfaction and occupant comfort; 
• Demonstrate the proposed solutions in at least three pilots. These pilots should 
collectively cover at least three different climatic zones, three different building types 
(residential, tertiary etc.), and three different technical building systems; 
• Develop a methodology to measure the achieved energy demand reduction, increased 
flexibility in the grid, and enhanced interoperability, compared to current best practices; 
• Investigate the cost-effectiveness and replicability of the proposed solutions.   
This topic is a Societal-Readiness pilot: 
• Proposals should follow the instructions applying to the Societal readiness pilot, as 
described in the introduction of the Horizon Europe Main Work Programme 2025 for 
Climate, Energy and Mobility. They entail the use of an interdisciplinary approach to 
deepening consideration and responsiveness of research and innovation activities to 
societal needs and concerns. 
• This topic requires effective contribution of the relevant SSH expertise, including the 
involvement of SSH experts in the consortium, to meaningfully support Societal 
Readiness. Specifically, SSH expertise is expected to facilitate the socio-technological 
interface and enable the design of project objectives with Societal Readiness related 
activities.

“Supporting the development of a roadmap for the reduction of whole life carbon of buildings”, 
European Union, 2023’. This publication commissioned by the European Commission includes the 
following definition: “Whole life carbon encompasses all greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the 
materials, construction and the use of a building over its entire life, including its demolition and 
disposal. It is thus the total amount of embodied and operational emissions.”

• Quantified pathways to improved buildings’ and built environment’s whole life carbon 
performance.  
Scope: EU and associated countries continue to develop innovative building solutions that 
support the decarbonisation and climate resilience of buildings and the built environment, 
addressing energy performance, circularity, sustainability, resource efficiency, climate 
resilience, safety, durability and adaptability of the building stock, and whole life carbon 
emissions. A key challenge remains the accelerated uptake of such solutions in building and 
renovation projects. Building value chain actors - such as housing association, municipal and 
regional authorities, or policy makers - require planning methods and procedures that embed 
the uptake of innovative building solutions and define pathways for the decarbonisation and 
climate resilience of the building stock and the built environment under their responsibility. 
Proposals are expected to address all of the following: 
• Develop and validate replicable and scalable planning methods and procedures that 
embed the uptake of innovative sets of building solutions when developing or 
regenerating (including deconstruction aspects when relevant) the building stock and the 
built environment; 
• Validate the planning methods, procedures and sets of building solutions in a relevant 
environment in at least three countries, with different climatic conditions and building 
stock characteristics. In at least two cases, the proposed planning methods and 
procedures should be relevant for renovation; 
• Investigate the use of innovative tools and methods which facilitate the adaptation of the 
buildings stock to changing user needs, while positively contributing to occupants’ 
comfort and health; 
• Propose and apply a methodology for assessing the effectiveness of the developed 
pathways for the decarbonisation and climate resilience of buildings and the built 
environment, including the calculation of their whole life carbon reduction compared to 
a “business as usual” scenario; 
• Ensure the active involvement of all relevant public and private stakeholders of the 
whole renovation and construction value chain, which must include among others: 
municipalities, citizens (including vulnerable groups) and civil society organisations and 
the building and construction sector professions; 
• Contribute to the objectives of the Built4People partnership and its network of 
innovation clusters184.  
Selected proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint 
Research Centre (JRC) whose contribution could consist of providing added value on 
innovative building solutions for resource efficiency, safety, durability and adaptability of the

Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Increased number of approaches and solutions enabling a net positive yearly energy 
balance at district level and the export of excess renewable energy to the grid outside its 
geographical boundaries, with enhanced replicability on a larger scale in other positive 
energy districts (PEDs) in different contexts; 
• Measurable increase in inclusiveness and public acceptance of the implementation of 
PEDs; 
• Improved user-friendliness and user-awareness of guidelines, tools, and training 
materials targeting key professionals for overcoming the different types of barriers 
towards the realisation of PEDs.   
Scope: Recent projects have demonstrated the feasibility of PEDs, but there is a need to 
further demonstrate climate-neutral impact, while developing and demonstrating innovative 
approaches and solutions for overcoming technical, business, social and organisational 
constraints in several domains. Such domains include, for example, climate mitigation, 
integration of renewable energy sources and energy storage in buildings, grid connections, 
accommodation of distributed energy generation and storage at district level, permitting, data 
privacy and security and the application of new technologies such as artificial intelligence. 
Presently, these constraints, which inhibit the demonstration of complete and qualified PEDs, 
require the cooperation of key professionals from the public and private sector, such as 
municipal and regional authorities and those from the energy and construction sectors, in 
complex implementation processes. 
Proposals are expected to address all of the following: 
• Demonstrate innovative approaches and solutions for overcoming constraints which 
prevent the successful implementation of PEDs; 
• Develop supportive local planning frameworks for the design and realisation of PEDs; 
• Demonstrate the proposed approaches, solutions, and supportive local planning 
frameworks in at least three districts in diverse geographical areas that implement energy 
efficiency measures alongside renewable energy installations, storage solutions, digital 
and smart technologies, and local energy communities;

Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Measurable reduction in whole life carbon emissions187 and uptake of carbon removals 
in buildings; 
• Increased integration of circular approaches for building construction and renovation 
works, with the aim of minimising lifecycle impacts; 
• Availability of more accurate benchmarks and calculations of typical buildings’ whole 
life carbon emissions and carbon removals, based on Level(s) and consistent with the 
life-cycle global warming potential provisions under the Energy Performance of 
Buildings Directive.   
Scope: Buildings result in greenhouse gas emissions over their whole life cycle (operational 
and embodied emissions). Buildings can also contribute to long-term carbon removals by 
storing carbon in construction products. Construction and renovation works must also meet a 
variety of inter-related requirements such as structural and fire safety, acoustics, and a healthy 
and comfortable indoor environment. Although much research has focused on developing 
materials and products with reduced whole life carbon emissions, the life cycle impacts of 
buildings depend on a complex interaction between individual products, components and 
technical building systems, spatial distribution, usage during their lifetime, and other design 
choices. There is therefore a need to deliver buildings and renovation works with minimal life 
cycle impacts, in particular global warming potential, based on circularity principles, also 
accommodating future building use-change through design for flexibility, and using 
innovative combinations of products and systems that result in optimal building-level 
performance. 
Proposals are expected to address all the following: 
• Develop solutions that facilitate optimal combinations of construction products and 
systems with minimal life cycle environmental impacts at the level of the building. The 
optimal combinations of products and systems must also account for relevant aspects of 
performance such as structural integrity, thermal, acoustic and hygrometric, durability, 
potential for deconstruction and preparation for reuse at end of life, and potential for

Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Based on the results of the project, at least one industrial sector with a significant heating 
demand in the EU and Associated Countries develops pathways and business models to 
improve its energy efficiency, and to significantly reduce its consumption of fossil fuel 
and its emissions of GHG and other pollutants (including air pollutants), while 
preserving / enhancing its global competitiveness; 
• With the goal of completely phasing out the use of fossil fuels in an industrial plant with 
a significant heating demand, the process(es) is(are) tightly integrated to minimise 
energy losses and its (their) energy supply relies on the local integration of a 
combination of renewable energy sources, including, where appropriate, process 
flexibility and storage to minimise its demand on the electricity grid.   
Scope: Proposals are expected to demonstrate an innovative solution for the efficient, long 
lasting and cost-effective local integration of one or a combination of renewable thermal, 
electrical, bioenergy and other renewable energy sources in industrial processes, for heating, 
cooling and power generation, while optimising process efficiency and reuse, possibly 
upgrade of excess heat, with the aim of avoiding or drastically reducing fossil fuel use. 
Process flexibility and energy storage can also be integrated, to match the energy demand of 
the industrial process with the variable renewable energy supply profile, and to minimise 
electricity demand from the power grid. Where possible, the integration with neighbouring 
industries and/or communities should be considered for the benefit of energy and resources 
sharing and efficiency. 
The solution should be designed to ensure that the industrial process avoids or has very low 
GHG and other pollutant emissions, ensures high reliability and safety, and high physical and 
cyber security. It should be physically demonstrated in an industrial environment and be 
applicable to a significant share of the total energy demand of the industrial plant. The project 
should demonstrate through numerical simulations that the physically demonstrated solution 
can be scaled up to completely phase out the use of fossil fuels. 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025

The project should facilitate the future deployment of the solution in the EU and Associated 
Countries’ plants in the same industrial sector(s). Already before starting the design phase, the 
needs of most EU and Associated Countries’ factories in the same industrial sector(s) should 
be surveyed and analysed in order to design a solution that can be adapted to meet most of 
them, to identify common components to be optimised/standardised and to issue/disseminate 
technical and economic guidelines. 
Proposals are expected to present a strong business model and sound exploitation strategy for 
the proposed solution, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination.

Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all the following outcomes:  
• Bidirectional, interoperable low-power wireless (i.e., inductive) stationary charging 
solutions and services are demonstrated in operational environment for Light Duty 
Vehicle (vehicle category M1 and N1), with significantly reduced losses of power 
transfer reaching at least 90% power transfer efficiency in both directions and increased 
robustness against humidity and dirt, and in all weather conditions (including rain, snow 
and ice); 
• Enhanced electro-magnetic compatibility (EMC) within health and safety limits 
conforming to international standards (e.g. SAE J2954, IEC 61980-1/-2/-3, CISPR 11 
and ISO 19363) as well as avoiding interference with relevant telecommunication 
regulations and Low Frequency(LF)-based navigation systems (e.g., eLORAN); 
• Enhanced social acceptance of automatic park and charge functionalities with increased 
comfort and complete cost/benefit assessment at system-level for acceptable costs; 
• Demonstration of the solutions and their efficient integration into the electricity grid in 
on-street parking (and optionally in parking lots), incorporating advanced V2X 
technologies to ensure seamless interaction between the vehicles and energy systems to 
enhance the robustness and efficiency of the wireless charging solutions; 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 181 of 313 
• Deeper understanding of the needs and concerns of diverse social groups involved in or 
potentially affected by the R&I development (e.g. employing synthetic population 
models and tools), thereby increasing the potential for beneficial societal uptake and 
building trust in results and outcomes.   
Scope: Wireless stationary charging for road light duty vehicles can be a solution to minimise 
the intrusiveness of the charging infrastructures, which is critical in urban environments. 
Moreover, it can provide the EV user with a hands-free way of charging, which is of 
particular benefit for people with disabilities or other weaknesses. The holistic system 
approach of EV integration into electricity grids entails bi-directional power between EV and 
the grid to maximise the battery capacity exploitation for grid-and market-oriented services. 
Recent progress on wireless bidirectionality of charging technologies motivates the need for 
additional demonstrations with further improved efficiency190. The focus of this topic is the 
development of the charging system, the integration of the system into the vehicle and its 
demonstration in real life operations. Limited optimisations concerning on-board systems not 
directly related to the wireless charging (e.g. BMS and battery) may be included if properly 
justified. 
Proposals are expected to address all the following aspects: 
• Design, develop and demonstrate cost-effective, standardised, safe, visually not 
intrusive, efficient technologies, solutions and user-centric services offered for bi-
directional automatic wireless charging for road Light Duty Vehicles; 
• Investigate ways to maximise efficiency through charging plate and power electronic 
design and positioning (such as auto-positioning of vehicle and/or transmitters/receivers) 
to increase comfort and social responsiveness of parking and stationary charging; 
• Avoid detrimental effects from obstacles such as garbage or amounts of dirt that might 
interfere with the power transfer and/or might cause damage; 
• Efficient system integration of bidirectional wireless charging infrastructures and 
services to support Renewable Energy Sources (RES) deployment, grid balancing, and 
investments analysis, making use of generative AI where beneficially applicable; 
• Analyse the environmental footprint of the solution following a Life Cycle Assessment 
(LCA) approach including reuse, repair and recycling/recovery, in particular to reduce 
use of critical raw materials, and perform a Costs-and-Benefits analysis on the 
development and the deployment of the proposed solutions; 
• Demonstrate solutions and services in at least three different urban areas (peri-urban 
and/or rural are excluded) within Horizon Europe participating countries considering 
different climatic conditions and for a period of at least three months;

• Exploitation of synergies with projects related to the Software-Defined Vehicle of the 
Future191 is encouraged where applicable.   
This topic is a Societal-Readiness pilot: 
• Proposals should follow the instructions applying to the Societal readiness pilot, as 
described in the introduction of the Horizon Europe Main Work Programme 2025 for 
Climate, Energy and Mobility. They entail the use of an interdisciplinary approach to 
deepening consideration and responsiveness of research and innovation activities to 
societal needs and concerns. 
• This topic requires effective contribution of the relevant SSH expertise, including the 
involvement of SSH experts in the consortium, to meaningfully support Societal 
Readiness. Specifically, SSH expertise is expected to facilitate the socio-technological 
interface and enable the design of project objectives with Societal Readiness related 
activities.   
The project(s) should contribute to the activities of existing working groups for the definition 
of standards for EV wireless charging. 
The project(s) should take account Open Science, its practices and learning, and the project’s 
results will be enacted in line with FAIR principles for data192. 
Proposals should consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research 
Centre (JRC) whose contribution could consists of performing experimental or desk-top 
research on Electromagnetic Compliance and Safety.

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 184 of 313 
Scope: The system approach of the e-mobility entails the interconnection of several e-
mobility actors with the technologies (EVs, EVSEs) and e-mobility users but also the 
establishment of communication interfaces among e-mobility/energy actors via different ICT 
systems, front-end and back-end systems. On one hand, the charging infrastructures should be 
open and accessible (to everyone, for all users, for all types of EVs, software systems, 
charging protocols and apps, communication networks) and, on the other hand, they must 
fully comply with the Cyber-Resilience Act (CRA) by November 2027 and hence be secured 
from hackers, criminals, and other malicious parties. It is critical to ensure that all these 
interactions are secured and reliable, also considering the transition of the automotive industry 
towards the software-defined vehicle (SDV) concept and the continuous Over-The-Air (OTA) 
software (SW) updates. A cyber-attack on any level of the e-mobility ecosystem may have 
financial and/or operational implications which might result in wider disruptions, up to 
nationwide power outage. 
Proposals are expected to address all the following aspects: 
• Develop a secure-by-design architecture and secure design principles encompassing all 
components and direct interfaces with EVs, EVSE, Charging Point Operators and E-
Mobility Service Providers (EMSP) within the e-mobility ecosystem 194 considering 
governance models involving the roles and responsibilities of the different actors; 
• Conduct a thorough threat analysis and risk assessment to identify potential security 
vulnerabilities within the ecosystem, also analysing the security of interfaces with all 
involved actors (e.g., EV Aggregators, Facility Managers, Flexibility Providers, 
Distribution System Operators, etc.) when applying V2X services; 
• Define a comprehensive testing framework for penetration including reacting against 
live attacks to EVSE as well as to vehicle network on hardware (HW) and software 
(SW) components to uncover potential weaknesses and vulnerabilities, including 
behavioural aspects such as sub-standard repair or vehicle tampering; 
• Implement a shared system of systems testing approach and develop co-designed 
verification and certification methods (also via Hackathon); 
• Demonstrate in real-life operational environment the use of the framework for testing the 
cyber security and resilience of vehicles and charging infrastructure isolated and in 
connection to situations like charging, preparing for charging and payment processing; 
• Compliance with existing standards195 and best practices for security, resilience, and 
robustness of e-mobility systems for more secured systems should be ensured, making 
use, where applicable, of generative AI; 
 
194 
The cyber security analysis for connected vehicles performed by the European Union Agency for 
Cybersecurity (ENISA) and Joint Research Centre (JRC) should be considered.

• Extend Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) deployment, while considering emerging 
cryptography threats (i.e., quantum crypto) and exploring solutions, particularly focusing 
on pre-emptive measures against Post-Quantum Cryptographic attacks; 
• Support to the set-up and implementation of the EC’s PKI ecosystem governance based 
on ISO 15118-20 standard; 
• Develop digital twins to help define vulnerable elements of infrastructure and identify 
measures for risk mitigation; 
• Consider the HW/SW elements and communication channels spanning from vehicles to 
charging stations and the electricity grid as a proactive design to mitigate vulnerabilities 
across the entire chain; 
• Exploitation of synergies with projects related to the Software-Defined Vehicle of the 
Future196 is encouraged where applicable.

Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all the following outcomes:  
• Significant improvement of vehicle designs (especially the design of the most recent 
battery pack and its integration into the vehicle) from the perspective of fire-hazard 
reduction, fire suppression, crashworthiness and post-crash handling compared with the 
baseline vehicle, following specific design guidelines; 
• Advanced BEV condition assessment methods and tools with a focus on the condition of 
the battery as the most critical sub-system, providing safety-relevant information in a 
standardised format useful for rescue, towing and after-treatment services, 
complementing the digital battery passport, ensuring the safety of workers in all these 
phases, minimising environmental hazards and easy to apply by practitioners – towards 
standardised procedures; 
• Re-purposing/re-using/re-cycling of batteries from crashed BEVs facilitated by tailored 
interventions, high confidence in battery health condition and standardised handover 
protocols, thus supporting potential second-life applications of batteries from crashed 
BEVs; 
• Best practices in fire handling and fire suppression, rescue procedures and handling of 
crashed Light Duty BEVs applied all over Europe, supported by training material and 
instructions for ‘first responders’, such as firefighters and emergency service workers; 
• Dispelling safety concerns of (potential) BEV users as well as policy/decision makers by 
science-based communication and comparative statistics.   
Scope: In addition to protection during a collision, it is the post-crash phase, immediately 
after the collision, that is crucial for the consequences of a road crash. Vehicle fires are a key 
concern in this post-crash phase. While there are many similarities to fires in vehicles with 
Internal Combustion Engines (ICEV), road electric vehicle battery fires pose a range of new 
challenges to emergency responders and everyone handling EVs post-incident, including tow, 
repair, storage, salvage & wrecking. The rescue of victims, the safety of first responders and 
safe, efficient, and timely firefighting measures are key factors. The latter in particular poses

important challenges specific to road electric vehicles, amongst others due to the chemical 
composition of state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries, the placement of the battery in the 
vehicles, enclosed in a water-tight, protective compartment, and the volume of water needed 
to cool a burning high-capacity battery. This is a challenge in particular in constrained spaces, 
such as in tunnels. 
There is a need to support the definition of standards and procedures both in terms of risk but 
also in terms of response. With a focus on Light Duty Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), 
proposed actions will identify and further develop optimum technological solutions, processes 
and best practices towards future standards, design guidelines and official instructions / 
service regulations. 
Proposals are expected to address all the following aspects: 
• Vehicle health assessment tools after a crash, with a focus on the assessment of the 
battery and high-voltage system condition, ensuring that the HV battery is in a safe and 
stable condition (avoidance or early detection of thermal runaway after a collision), and 
maximising the likelihood of keeping the battery in service in the vehicle once fixed / re-
using it, in line with the proposed regulation on circularity requirements, eco-design and 
end-of-life of vehicles. Both on-board monitoring systems and off-board systems can be 
considered; 
• If making use of connectivity to on-board monitoring systems, the accessibility to the 
health and safety information / data needs to be addressed. This includes the 
development of state of safety and state of health algorithms to provide the remaining 
useful life and potential safety risks of the battery after a collision, complementing the 
information on the digital battery passport198; 
• Extrication procedures protecting both crash victims and emergency service workers to 
the best possible extent, also considering the gender dimension. To ensure the 
effectiveness of fire handling, suppression, and rescue procedures for crashed BEVs, it is 
crucial to further develop these practices in close collaboration with first responders; 
• Fire extinguishing techniques and firefighting procedures for BEVs (if the case also 
including innovative fire extinguishing media), considering the risks specific for EV 
including potential toxic products of the associated chemical reactions, as well as vehicle 
designs supporting firefighting. Particular attention should be paid to the design of the 
battery pack and its integration into the vehicle, including auxiliaries; 
• Develop and implement procedures and tools for the safe handover, handling, transport 
and storage of crashed BEVs, with wide dissemination to relevant stakeholders towards 
standardised procedures; 
 
198 
With regard to monitoring techniques and algorithms, proposals are expected to coordinate and exploit 
synergies with research topic HORIZON-CL5-2024-D2-02-04 on “Accelerated multi-physical and 
virtual testing for battery aging, reliability and safety evaluation” under the Batt4EU Partnership.

• Quantify the rate and severity of BEV fire safety impacts by conducting a comparative 
study addressing aspects such as frequency of BEV fire and severity of outcome, and 
provide statistical analysis to deliver science-based communication on the safety of 
Light Duty BEVs to the general public; 
• Real-life demonstration (in comparison to the state-of-art) of Light Duty (vehicle 
category M1 and N1) BEV condition assessment tools, data analysis, as well as 
firefighting, rescue, and handling procedures on a series production vehicle;   
The project should actively seek interaction with and make use of results from workshops on

Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all the following outcomes:  
• Holistic improved understanding of ageing and degradation of critical electric drive 
components relevant from a system integration point of view (fitting, mounts, 
connectors, sealings…) of Light Duty (vehicle category M1 and N1) BEV enabling user-
centric designs for longer life and for higher residual values to minimise the 
environmental impact and to strengthen European resource sovereignty; 
• 20 % higher residual value 202  through longer lifetime of BEV increasing material 
efficiency and productivity in comparison to baseline, state of the art vehicle; 
• Future sustainable, economy-design concept evaluation for extended lifetime with 
minimum use of resources and re-use, recycle and End of Life (EoL) strategies 
applicable for advanced technology development; 
• Advanced prospective/prescriptive maintenance and repair concepts to extend useful 
lifetime of BEV and minimise the used resources (20% reduction in resources in the use 
phase) and environmental footprint (5% reduction).   
Scope: Currently, the value of a vehicle is mostly defined by driven mileage and age, 
underestimating the actual residual value. However, the real actual residual value of a BEV

and its component should help implement Circular Economies (CE) strategies beyond 
classical shredding, such as reuse, remanufacturing, recovery of precious material. The 
residual value is determined by ageing and degradation in the use phase, repair and 
maintenance measures, operation of the vehicle and also by a CE-specific design. 
Consequently, prospective/prescriptive maintenance strategies, repairability and upgradability 
of vehicles must be addressed in relation to actual ageing and degradation of a component as 
part of upcoming CE strategies (including 9R approaches) to ensure longer (in terms of higher 
residual values) and more sustainable lifetimes of road BEV without over-sizing components 
and/or increasing the use of raw materials. 
This topic focuses on the road BEV electric drive components relevant from a system 
integration point of view where high combined operational loads are to be expected, on the 
thermal management systems as well as on power electronics. The ageing and degradation of 
pack and module level is included whereas the battery cell level is excluded. 
Proposals are expected to address all the following aspects: 
• Analyse holistically the ageing and degradation of relevant, critical BEV functions and 
relevant sub-systems (excluding battery cells), that determine the Vehicle Lifetime and 
residual value under the aspect of functionality, safety and economic considerations 
(e.g., through correlating real-life operational loads with observed degradation and 
ageing effects); 
• Develop tools and methods to assess, measure and predict ageing and degradation of 
relevant sub-systems (e.g. modelling combining multi-physical models describing 
ageing/degradations and vehicle operation and applying AI approaches, non-invasive 
evaluation to describe ageing and degradation over lifetime, multi-physical testing to 
accelerated occurrence of realistic ageing and degradation phenomena, use of novel 
sensors for measuring ageing and degradation in an electric drivetrain, etc.); 
• Develop extended lifetime concepts and assess lifetime extension measures for BEV 
ensuring high residual values including right-sized design, operation, maintenance, 
refurbish and repair, by e.g. definition of prospective maintenance strategies, 
implementing ageing / degradation models into the design, advanced control strategies to 
minimise operational loads contributing to ageing and degradation phenomena including 
sensor technologies to obtain real-life operational data; 
• For all relevant, critical components, follow the “digital product passport” approach, to 
achieve maximum traceability203; 
• Data management for operational loads, maintenance, and repair measures; 
 
203 
The “Digital Product Passport” will provide information about products’ environmental sustainability. 
This information will be easily accessible by scanning a data carrier and it will include attributes such 
as the durability and reparability, the recycled content or the availability of spare parts of a product.

Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all the following outcomes:  
• Validated set of user requirements and usage acceptance limits, e. g. acceptable range 
loss for cabin climatisation, for different vehicle user groups (e. g. age, income, gender, 
location, regular usage models) in consideration of driving habits under various weather 
conditions as a basis for system development; 
• Innovative and affordable Light Duty Vehicles (LDV) / Light Commercial Vehicles 
(LCV) energy management solutions demonstrated with a prototypical system (e. g. 
mock-up vehicle) in relevant environment and compared with State of the Art. Solutions 
should be cost effectively fulfilling and balancing user needs (from comfort and air 
quality aspects such as temperatures, humidity, CO2, to driving range) under extreme 
weather conditions (-15°C to at least +40°C, aiming to +45°C); 
• User and use case specific vehicle range loss (due to climatisation needs) at extreme 
ambient conditions will be reduced to user acceptance limits. Compared to State of the 
Art for an affordable system design, the range loss from normal operating conditions 
(e.g., 10 to 20 °C) to extreme ambient conditions will be reduced by at least 30% without 
increasing system cost (e.g. energy, battery and thermal management); 
• Optimal energy management including integration of future smart cities standards (e.g., 
speed control, environmental forecasting, swarm information, smart energy 
management, grid peak load periods) resulting in 10% improvement of energy demand 
for the thermal system and the powertrain.   
Scope: Preserving the benefits of right-sized batteries in terms of road BEV affordability, 
material resource and energy savings while reducing the impact of occasional extreme 
weather conditions on driving range for both LDV and LCV, especially during longer trips, 
calls for novel systemic approaches on thermal management. Finding solutions which 
adequately balance user needs, technical effort and vehicle affordability requires user research 
(e. g. user acceptance, preferences, and usage scenarios for the vehicles) to set relevant goals 
and criteria for innovation in the field of thermal management systems and technologies. 
Automotive standards (e.g. ISO 7730, ISO 14505-4) should be met, keeping in mind that 
extreme weather conditions are a critical challenge and should be tackled not only with 
innovative or improved components, but especially with novel, user-centric and intelligent 
solutions based on an overall vehicle system approach (can include interface to infrastructure) 
to minimise energy and simplify thermal systems and which do not lead to increased system 
or vehicle cost.

Proposals are expected to address all the following aspects: 
• Analyse user requirements to identify personalised thresholds of thermal comfort and 
their different expectations and behaviours, sensitivities, tolerances, and acceptance with 
regard to various use cases; 
• Establish a holistic approach to optimising energy efficiency and relevant thermal 
functions (system-oriented and simplified solutions based on usage scenarios and 
inclusion of external data to use energy optimally and avoid oversizing that could also 
result from cascading engineering safety margins); 
• Explore and exploit the potential that connection to the grid offers without overloading 
the grid especially during extreme weather conditions; 
• Develop innovative, safe and intelligent solutions that reduce the loss of range within 
acceptable limits also addressing the balance of costs, usage models and system

Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all the following outcomes:  
• Accelerated uptake of Heavy Duty (HD) Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) across the EU 
and Associated Countries, through innovative logistics models, addressing the need to 
optimise battery size and charging strategies across various logistics scenarios; 
• Enhanced reliability and effectivity of the road freight systems enabled by the 
development and implementation of software tools for decision making considering 
truck configurations, charging strategies, missions and efficient operational planning of 
routes and services, including charging and interoperable cross-border services; 
• Increased portfolio of real-life HD-BEV operational demonstrations for long-haul and 
cross border operations and associated logistics models; 
• Enhanced understanding of EU and Associated Countries stakeholders’ needs for 
integrating HD-BEVs in logistics operations, also long-term novel usage models.   
Scope: It is expected that by 2030 there will be around half a million of HD-BEV on 
European roads. Nonetheless, the current market application of these vehicles is largely 
confined to transport tasks with restricted range and considerable repetition. To expand their

use, diverse strategies and applications must be explored and validated for scalability based 
on real data coming from logistics operators. The development of new application models 
should showcase the potential flexibility of HD-BEVs and assist end-users in establishing 
innovative usage frameworks and models. 
Several actions are already underway for HD-BEV logistics (including the projects funded 
under the 2Zero topics HORIZON-CL5-2022-D5-01-08 and HORIZON-CL5-2024-D5-01-
04) with a focus on extending range and charging capacity but also identifying challenges, 
gaps and impacts of HD-BEV usage in logistics operation. There is an urgent need to address 
these challenges and gaps for a smooth transition into daily operations and considering the 
wide variety of use cases and missions to be addressed.  
Finding the optimal balance between the vehicle’s configuration and available charging 
infrastructure for different logistics use cases is key to address the Total Cost of Ownership 
(TCO) challenge in the short and long term. This balancing will be enhanced by innovative 
logistics models and tools to further optimise logistics regional and long-haul operations in 
different regions in the EU and Associated Countries accelerating the deployment of HD 
BEVs for logistics. 
Proposals are expected to address all the following aspects: 
• Derive in-depth insights and lessons learnt from current long-haul transport missions in 
the EU and Associated Countries along major road arteries (e. g. the Trans-European 
Transport Network (TEN-T) corridors and nodes) towards overcoming the limitations 
determined by vehicle range and TCO and propose cost-effective HD BEV based 
logistics and operational models, building on modular vehicles set up and sound 
charging strategies. These models should include use cases across the EU and 
Associated Countries focused on long-haul transport missions and be based on existing, 
real operations data; 
• Test and validate in real demonstrations new logistic operational concepts and models 
allowing a scalable deployment of HD-BEV in long haul transport missions optimising 
the different variabilities of a shipment (range, charging time, various European regions, 
drivers required break/rest times etc.). 
• Develop and test associated digital tools for effective, robust integration in the overall 
logistics operations and fleets, and facilitating interoperable cross-border services. These 
associated digital tools – where relevant also developed as digital twins – are to enable 
and support efficient optimisation of the concepts, models, solutions and operations; 
• Real-life demonstrations should be based on existing fleets of operators (e.g. haulers, 
shippers, freight forwarders) with different categories of vehicles and missions. 
Demonstration should at least include 8 different types of long-haul missions in different 
climatic conditions, including cross-border missions, and involve several logistic 
companies and/or logistic users; 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025

Part 8 - Page 196 of 313 
• Develop scenarios for optimum balance of vehicles’ performance and configuration, 
charging strategies and solutions. The scenarios will include information on the distance 
dependency as a function of vehicle combinations, location and capacity of charging 
stations and payload demands; 
• The demonstrated concepts, models and tools should allow strategies for firm upscaling 
of HD-BEV implementation, taking into account the logistics operational models, the 
performance of complete vehicle combinations also considering the effects of on-board 
batteries on the ageing and energy recuperation;

results will be enacted in line with FAIR principles for data208.

Community (2021-2025). 210. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results should focus on new and adapted testing capabilities for 
next generation climate neutral aviation. Project results are expected to contribute to all of the 
following expected outcomes: 
• Airframe transformative technologies, including airframe-propulsion integration; 
• High aspect ratio and/or highly flexible unfuelled wing; 
• Distributed hybrid/electric propulsion; 
• Airframe and propulsion aeroacoustics; 
• Further advancements of experimental simulation capabilities required for novel low-
emission aircraft towards reducing further the lead times.   
Scope: The new mission letter to Commission-designate for startups, research and innovation 
called for new long-term strategy to boost European Research Infrastructures, recognising the 
need to further strengthen the European research and technology linked to strategic facilities, 
as they can greatly contribute to the competitiveness of the European economy. 
In parallel to ongoing research policy initiatives which aim to define the future EU landscape 
and funding programmes to support technology infrastructures, the advancement of science 
and technologies is necessary for the development of new and adapted testing capabilities. EU 
wind-tunnels is a prime example of such strategic capabilities towards climate-neutral 
aviation. The Horizon 2020 RINGO project has provided an analysis of needs, gaps and 
overlaps of European Aviation R&I Infrastructures, especially strategic infrastructures, in 
order to achieve Flightpath 2050 goals, while a recent internal effort has updated, refined and 
prioritised those findings. 
The scope of this topic is focused on better understanding and further advancing critical 
technologies that require the update of relevant strategic EU testing capabilities, in particular 
wind tunnels. While new instrumentation and development of new testing procedures and 
digital tools is within the scope of this topic, other Research and Technology Infrastructure 
investments (i.e., buildings, auxiliary facilities, etc) fall outside of the scope. 
The complexity of multi-disciplinary design and optimisation of future aircrafts requires 
extensive computational efforts, validated by wind-tunnel and propulsion testing. The scope 
of this topic is confined by strategic priorities and proposed aircraft concepts as defined in the

Emphasis is placed on airframe and propulsion transformative technologies, including the 
integration of advanced propulsion architectures on the airframe, distributed hybrid/electric 
propulsion, high aspect ratio and highly flexible unfuelled wing (e.g. for LH2 aircraft), 
boundary layer ingestion, ground effects in new aircraft architectures and aeroacoustics. 
The projects should be aligned with the Fly the Green Deal vision and 2050 climate neutral 
aviation objectives and if possible, exploit synergies with other EU and National projects. In 
those cases that the participation of multiple testing facilities is required, the projects should 
also define and agree upon interfaces, common architectures and common data exchange

Expected Outcome: Project results should contribute to the European civil aircraft cockpit 
technology roadmaps on crew assistance/automation/autonomy, with focus to next generation 
aircraft autonomy technologies for cockpit / pilot assistance applications.  
Project results are expected to contribute to at least two of the following expected outcomes: 
• Increasing safety in cockpits, by providing to the crew’s assistance new systems or 
functionalities. with new capabilities for new aircraft platforms, new Human Machine 
Interface concepts and technologies.; 
• Contribution to the roadmap of cockpits digitalisation and autonomy, by conceiving new 
cockpit capabilities, allowing an enhanced Human-System Relation (new ways for the 
crews to interact or collaborate with the cockpit). Technological breakthrough could 
bring to future cockpits the development potential necessary to take up the challenges of 
the next decades; 
• Increased efficiency of cockpits performances: reduction of size, weight and power 
consumption (SWaP) of systems and equipment, reduced total lifecycle costs, integration 
levels by reduced production times and, first-time-right delivery.   
Scope: Next generation aircrafts will be even more digital and automated, with more 
interactive and automated cockpits. This will be even more reliant on automation evolution 
and it is expected to mitigate an always-increased complexity of aircraft systems and 
operations, ensuring safe and efficient operations. However, automation is also prone to 
significant errors when misused or misunderstood, especially if this is combined with new 
aircraft platforms (incl. new systems/capabilities) or new types of operations. 
The projects should develop new technology bricks in line with the aircraft concepts proposed 
in the updated Horizon Europe Clean Aviation Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda212 
and possibly exploit lessons learned from the H2020-CS2 Large Aircraft Disruptive Cockpit 
Demonstrator213. Synergies may also be sought with Horizon Europe SESAR Single Person 
Operations projects. 
The technology bricks should be aligned with the needs of future aircraft generations and 
operations, new requirements, and cockpit philosophy of European aircraft integrators for the 
next generations of aircrafts, while they should be cyber-resilient and controlled by a single 
pilot and without the assistance of an on-board human co-pilot. Development of simulation

Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes: 
• The waterborne industry will have near-to-market solutions for the safe integration and 
use of low and zero-carbon fuel power conversion systems as the main power source for 
vessels above 5,000 Gross Tonnage (GT) with overall energy efficiencies at least 55% in 
shaft propulsion; 
• Equipment manufacturers and ship owners will have access to a knowledge repository to 
support standardisation for using low and zero-carbon fuels and ensuring technical 
compatibility between the fuel and energy conversion system; 
• Public authorities, port terminals and ship operators will have access to a knowledge 
repository to identify hazardous scenarios for low and zero-carbon fuels used in the 
demonstration and their potential impact in ports, including risk control options, as well 
as development of protocols for safe response operations in case of an accidental release 
of low or zero-carbon fuels; 
• The EU waterborne industry, including shipyards and equipment manufacturers will gain 
an increased competitive advantage due to the development of innovative software 
demonstrating optimised integration of energy technologies; 
• The workforce across the value chain, including on-board crews and port workers 
directly handling low and zero-carbon fuels and carrying bunkering operations, will gain 
competences and certified training in bunkering operations and port authorities' 
authorisations.  
Scope: The International Maritime Organisation (IMO)’s Greenhouse Gases (GHG) revised 
strategy of 2023 and the FuelEU Maritime Regulation have set ambitious goals to reduce the 
use of fossil fuels in waterborne transport. To that aim, maritime operators are working to 
replace the currently used engines with alternative power conversion systems that will allow 
the use of low and zero-carbon fuels for propulsion. Among all ship-types, the 
decarbonisation of long-distance shipping will rely the most on successful innovative 
solutions with high power outputs. Apart from greenhouse gas emissions, other pollutants and 
harmful ship emissions (e.g., NOx, SOx, PM, etc.) coming from the fuel mix currently used in 
waterborne transport and from low and zero-carbon fuels need to be lowered and eliminated 
where possible. This topic aims to integrate and further develop various fuel cells (FC) and 
internal combustion engines (ICEs) solutions for waterborne transport running on low and 
zero-carbon fuels and scaling-up their technological maturity on-board. Actions addressing 
these challenges should also align with the European Economic Security Strategy. 
Proposals should address one of the two following areas: 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 204 of 313 
Area A: Projects demonstrating FC solutions should deliver results that will reach a combined 
power output of at least 5 megawatts (MW) with energy supply provided by low and zero-
carbon fuels; 
Area B: ICEs solutions should demonstrate a combined power output of at least 10 MW with 
at least 85% of the energy supply provided by low and zero-carbon fuels. 
The two selected projects will be complementary, not demonstrating the same areas describe 
above. If in one of the areas no proposal meets the minimum thresholds, then only one project 
will be funded under this topic. 
Regarding GHG emission reduction, proposals should follow the provisions of FuelEU 
Maritime and the IMO GHG reduction strategy on fuel standards. 
Proposals should address all the following aspects, noting that appropriate consideration 
should be given to selecting a suitable design approach: 
• One full scale demonstrator of a vessel above 5 000 GT, showing the potential of 
integrated systems for 100% energy load provision under normal operations; 
• The demonstrated solutions identify their impact on air pollution, showing at least: i) 
90% reduction of NOx from IMO tier III; ii) sulphur emissions below 90% and; iii) a 
maximum of 5 mg/kWh of PM; 
• Consider fuel flexibility and address cost impacts of energy efficiency, taking into 
account impacts on vessel CAPEX and OPEX plus the opportunity cost of increased 
power conversion and fuel storage size and mass; 
• An innovative storage and handling solution on-board of ships and mixing of sustainable 
alternative fuels with sustainable or low carbon pilot fuels. In the case of proposals 
addressing Area B, solutions should demonstrate a reduction in the use of pilot fuels 
compared to solutions available on the market, aiming to avoid the use of pilot fuels 
altogether; 
• Solutions developed and proven to prevent and mitigate slippage and fugitive emission 
factors related to the use of (1) low and zero-carbon fuels and (2) the remaining non-
sustainable fuel used; 
• Demonstrate optimised integration of energy technologies with overall energy 
efficiencies from fuel energy to shaft propulsion of at least 55%, able to operate on low 
and zero-carbon fuels and close to zero direct pollutant and harmful ship emissions; 
• Identification of specific gaps in standardisation linked to the integration of the 
technologies researched and development of a roadmap to gather and disseminate the 
relevant data in support of standardisation, including communication and discussion with 
policy makers, industry, academic associations, and other relevant bodies; 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 205 of 313 
• Development of parameters ensuring technical compatibility between the fuel and 
energy conversion system; 
• Provide quantitative and qualitative validated risk and safety assessments and risk 
control options, including setting of safety rules and distances for bunkering, linked to 
the use of low and zero-carbon fuels on-board and impact in ports. Develop protocols for 
safe response through detection and dispersion modelling (both marine and 
atmospheric). Evaluate the relevant human and organisational risk factors, defining 
personnel protective equipment and adequate response techniques and equipment; 
• The plan for exploitation and dissemination of results should identify adequate business 
cases and provide a roadmap for the deployment of the proposed technology, including 
plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment. The proposals should identify 
opportunities and propose strategies for further market uptake under the Innovation Fund

port operators to use the developed solutions and operational procedures, for instance by 
leveraging the expertise and educational resources of leading training providers and 
universities; 
• In addition to the full-scale demonstrator, proposals should also conduct 3 replication 
studies on the scalability and transferability of the proposed solutions in different ship 
types, demonstrating the viability of the new tools, methods and process required for the

engines, or injection mechanisms but also virtual prototyping and hardware-in-the-loop 
testing for verification, especially for the (safety) automation systems. Impact on factors 
like load-steps, load acceptance, and vibrations should also be included, as to facilitate 
the design of high-performing, maintainable, and safe vessels must be taken into

low and zero-emission fuels (e.g., ammonia slip or N2O for ammonia or formaldehyde 
for methanol);

Procedure 
The procedure is described in General Annex F. The following exceptions 
apply: 
To ensure a balanced portfolio, grants will be awarded to applications not 
only in order of ranking but at least also to one proposal that is the highest 
ranked within area A or B, as described in the scope of the topic, provided 
that the applications attain all thresholds (and subject to available budget). 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Demonstrated 40% increase in fully electric long-distance autonomy for maritime 
vessels above 400 Gross Tonnage (GT) or inland river vessels above 86 meters, using 
batteries as the primary energy source; 
• Demonstrated innovative solutions in energy storage concepts, energy efficiency or rapid 
in-route charging; 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 207 of 313 
• Measures to increase the connectivity between islands and their connections to mainland 
are proposed and modal shift of cargo from road to inland waterway transport is fostered 
by presenting solutions ready for practical deployment; 
• Improved lifetime and safe use of batteries in waterborne transport by addressing the 
operation, degradation and failure modes associated with unique waterborne transport 
operating conditions; 
• Contribution to the competitiveness and strategic autonomy of the EU waterborne sector. 
The EU waterborne industry, including shipyards and equipment manufacturers will gain 
an increased competitive advantage through the development of key and cost-effective 
solutions for high energy densities storage systems and battery electric ships.  
Scope: Batteries are highly efficient carriers of renewable energy and their increased 
utilisation in various waterborne transport applications enables the decarbonisation and 
depollution of waterborne transport. Full battery-electrification is already being demonstrated 
for small and medium-scale vessels. This action aims to increase the range of fully-battery-
electric operation of waterborne transport vessels on this range of size. Actions addressing 
these challenges should also align with the European Economic Security Strategy. 
Proposals should address full scale demonstration of battery- electric operation in one of the 
two following areas:   
1.          
1. Area A: seagoing vessels over 400 GWT    
2. Area B: inland river vessels above 86 meters   
Proposals are expected to address all of the following aspects 
•  Demonstrate 40% increase in the vessel operating range with battery as the primary 
source of propulsion with respect to a 2024 state-of-the-art full electric baseline. The 
solutions should allow an operation range of at least 120 nautical miles (or equivalent, as 
appropriate for other applications) and be applicable to representative operating 
conditions of the chosen area (Area A: appropriate sea states; Area B: upstream and 
downstream operation on relatively free-flowing parts of major rivers). Proposed 
solutions can either be suitable for newbuilds or for retrofits on existing vessels. Project 
proposals should clearly indicate the baseline range, the expected range as an outcome of 
this project, and the corresponding operating conditions; 
• Innovative measures for range extension, which should go beyond the simple scaling up 
of existing commercial battery systems to increase the range. Solutions are expected to 
include one or more of the following: 
• New onboard energy storage system concepts enabling high energy-densities suitable for 
different waterborne applications; 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 208 of 313 
• Innovative onboard energy efficiency measures including but not limited to, thermal 
management, electrical architecture, high voltage electrical components, energy 
management and energy modelling for optimal operation including weather routing, 
integration of renewable energy technologies (e.g. photovoltaic panels, wind-assisted 
propulsion), and improved vessel hydrodynamic efficiency; 
• Concepts for extending the operating lifetime of batteries through advanced architecture, 
onboard monitoring, control, and analytics; 
• Concepts for rapid in-route charging or battery replenishment while maintaining desired 
operating schedules. Fast charging and onshore power supply (OPS) concepts should 
adhere to the IEC/IEEE standards which are under development, and the consortium is 
expected to liaise with the technical committee in IEC/IEEE and converge technical 
solution with standard under development. Other solutions enabling intermittent in-route 
power transfer to vessels may also be demonstrated. 
• Development of guidelines/recommendations for the safety assessment of the novel 
installations based on field testing. This should build on established safety guidelines 
and requirements such as the Guidance on the Safety of Battery Energy Storage Systems 
onboard ships (from the European Maritime Safety Agency – EMSA) and the 
requirements for fixed and swappable batteries on inland vessels (from the European 
Committee For Drawing Up Standards In The Field Of Inland Navigation – CESNI), as 
applicable, and contribute to their applicability to a wider scope of novel electrification 
solutions. Furthermore, recommendations for improving the guidelines and extending 
them to the demonstrated new battery installation solutions should be presented. 
Regulatory aspects for the pertinent safety-critical ship systems as well as fire safety 
solutions for the battery room should also be addressed; 
• Replication case studies showing the applicability of the developed solution under 
emulated conditions for at least two other waterborne applications. The studies should 
demonstrate the opportunities of the developed solution, including the conditions under 
which the target of 40% range extension can be achieved, and provide an outlook of how 
this can lead to further range extension in the future. These studies should pave the way 
for further exploitation and market uptake activities as requested in the following point; 
• The plan for exploitation and dissemination of results should identify adequate business 
cases and provide roadmap for the replication and deployment of the proposed 
technology, including plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment. 
Proposals should identify and propose opportunities for further market uptake under the 
Innovation Fund and complementary bunkering needs under CEF AFIF (Connecting 
Europe Facility – Transport Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Facility); 
• Development of material for training, reskilling and upskilling of seafarers and shore-
based personnel to use the developed solutions, by leveraging the expertise and 
educational resources of leading training providers and universities; 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 209 of 313 
• Proposals must justify the contribution of their objectives, results, intellectual property 
(IP) management and exploitation strategy to the EU added value creation and strategic 
autonomy throughout the supply and value chain, including competitiveness of the EU 
waterborne industry, enhancement of the EU’s R&I capacity, technological know-how

Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all the following outcomes: 
• Ship operators will benefit from the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), using techniques 
such as Machine Learning (ML) and Machine Reasoning, and improved instrumentation, 
as well as on monitoring and control systems to optimise ship operations, while 
integrating new fuel types, power conversion systems, propulsion and heat systems, 
wind-assisted propulsion, innovative energy storage systems (beyond conventional 
batteries), and other energy efficiency solutions; 
• Improved supervision, forecasting, and real-time control of the full spectrum and 
complexity of ship energy needs and flows and sea state, according to the variety of 
operation profiles (i.e., ship energy dynamics, varying -especially low- water levels); 
• Development of adaptable real-time optimisation strategies to accommodate expected 
and unforeseen operational conditions; 
• Improved calibration and certification of sensing systems, including low-cost innovative 
real-time sensors, to support the enforcement of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions 
reduction, as well as SOx and NOx emissions regulatory framework, both at a European 
(e.g., Sulphur Directive, NRMM Regulation) and international level (e.g., MARPOL 
Annex VI), as well as the reduction of emissions of any other relevant harmful 
emissions, leading towards common operational procedures, methodologies and 
reporting; 
• Improved ship design concepts including lessons learnt from energy efficiency 
optimisation, considering various parameters that influence ship performance under 
diverse operational conditions (e.g., wave characteristics, wind strength, hull biofouling 
growth rate, low water levels/droughts).   
Scope: Energy Management Systems (EMS) have the potential through adaptive control, ML 
and AI to optimise energy demand and minimise harmful emissions. This paradigm shift will 
also lead to increase vessel efficiency through pioneering assessments and optimised 
integration of groundbreaking power conversion and energy storage systems, Waste Heat 
Recovery (WHR) systems, machinery prognostics and system simulations, variable speed 
electric motors, and both centralised and modular energy micro-grid architectures. In parallel, 
such advancements allow for real-time exhaust gas monitoring, including particulates, SOx, 
NOx and GHG emissions, which could be integrated into the overall monitoring and adaptive 
control.

continuous mapping of ship operating profiles, energy flows, Greenhouse Gas (GHG) 
emissions, as well as SOx, NOx and other polluting emissions (e.g., emissions from 
methane slip), including the assessment of potential ammonia environmental footprint; 
• Development of advanced monitoring, supervision and forecasting models, by 
capitalizing on AI and ML capacities for real-time data analysis and feedback, 
considering both internal and external data sources; comprehensive machine learning 
and machine reasoning models should enable intelligent vessel performance monitoring 
and supervision, vessel operation optimisation and planning;

demand reduction and energy supply efficiency; 
• Showcase the flexibility of the adaptive energy management system using simulation 
methods for different vessels having various propulsion system types, operating in a 
wide range of environmental conditions;

Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Novel holistic intelligent tools for variable retrofit scenarios and new operational modes 
will be developed and then demonstrated by the application to a retrofit ship test case; 
• Measures to overcome the limitations of current generation of design tools will be 
proposed which currently do not account for the interferences and mutual influences 
among the various retrofit systems installed on board; 
• Contribution to the retrofitting of existing aging fleets in the EU; 
• Increased competitiveness of European shipyards, marine equipment providers and 
repair yards in the maritime green technology sector through the development of cost-
effective solutions, that support ship-owners in making the European fleet climate 
neutral and still competitive; 
• Accelerated regulatory approval processes, best practice guidance, and easy-to-
customise strategies for retrofitting by reducing the commercial risk of deployment for 
ship owners.   
Scope: In the quest to get energy reductions from retrofitting, new design requirements and 
constraints are emerging, e.g., due to the introduction of new low-carbon fuels, and new 
added propulsion systems (e.g., wind assisted systems). Furthermore, other technical

measures are not yet “standardised” for retrofitting existing ships, due to other difficulties or 
high costs.  
There is also a lack of design/retrofitting experience in applying these new solutions. A 
practical example is the space rearrangement in the electrification of the ship, including the 
installation of heavy battery sets, a solution that uses space: but changing ship’s volume and 
weight distribution along the beam might have a strong effect on the dynamic stability of the 
vessel.  
The realisation of ad-hoc web tools and guidelines to help with the retrofit task is currently 
under development, based on the limited number of new small-scale demonstrators within 
ongoing projects (e.g., Green Marine, RETROFIT55, etc.). 
These approaches combine mature and new technologies creating a decision-support system 
(DSS) that integrates these solutions. However, even if the final results have not been 
delivered yet, these projects are considering the retrofit problem in a silo-based mode, that is 
not including a full multidisciplinary design optimisation with the mutual interactions among 
the technologies. This might lead to difficulties in achieving overall optimal goals, therefore 
resulting in a limited impact on the transition to zero-emission waterborne. These simplified 
strategies are indeed not accounting, in a full coupled mode, for the interferences and mutual 
influences among the different retrofit systems installed on board (i.e. available space and 
payload, safety constraints, electrical constraints, etc.): in other terms, they are not 
considering the global problem of retrofitting in a holistic way, which is a major objective of 
this call. Also, the holistic intelligent tools could explore possibilities for modular or serial 
solutions which reduce costs of retrofitting. 
Furthermore, in the short and medium term we are and will be observing multiple ongoing 
regulatory processes (by IMO, EU, UNFCCC, ES-TRIN) developing frameworks and 
standards that will shape waterborne transport in the next decades. This further element of 
variability, i.e. the uncertainty in decarbonisation ambitions as well as on the variability in 
cost and availability of carbon-neutral fuels, not considered yet in the current approaches, 
claim for a large effort for new holistic retrofit intelligent design tools for exploring 
multidisciplinary solutions in variable decarbonisation scenarios. 
Innovative holistic intelligent design tools, with a multi-objective strategy and AI simulators, 
have to be developed rapidly and tested if we want to significantly contribute to the transition 
to zero-emission waterborne transport, and this has to be done by integrating the many sectors 
involved in the design.  
Proposals are expected to address all the following aspects:  
• The development of a novel intelligent design digital tool which can fully integrate 
decarbonising concepts (e.g., alternative fuel propulsion systems, auxiliary propulsion 
systems, renewable energy sources, etc.) and can be used for retrofit concepts; 
• The design digital tool should have the capability of considering together multiple 
decarbonisation solutions for operating vessels, accounting for reciprocal influences, and 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 214 of 313 
be able to integrate existing loading instrument (software or data package) for stability, 
weight and hull strength control; 
• Retrofit configurations might include changes in operational modes (e.g., slow steaming, 
weather routing, etc.) which should also be evaluated against human and organisational 
risk factors introduced; 
• The design tool should also include a life-cycle perspective from design to scrapping; 
• Preliminary (intermediate) validation of the design tool by testing at model scale original 
versus refitted ship solution, also assessing the environmental impact of the solutions, 
including on biodiversity, air quality and aerial and underwater noise; 
• Final demonstration, applying the tool in six virtual demonstrations, one for each one of 
the six ship types detailed in the Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda of the Zero-
Emission 
Waterborne 
Transport 
Partnership, 
considering 
together 
multiple 
decarbonisation solutions and producing final optimised refitted designs to be tested in 
operational environment conditions with a given operational profile. Participation of ship 
owners and operators to these virtual demonstrations should be ensured to pave the way 
to further market deployment of the solution and real retrofitting operations.

Expected Outcome: Proposals should cover one of the following outcomes:  
• Area A: port authorities and ship operators have fully flexible and mobile solutions to 
ensure that onshore power supply (OPS) can be provided within and across different 
terminals and port areas maximising operational benefits for port authorities, terminal 
and ship operators, optimising deployment or;  
• Area B: port authorities have available solutions to provide OPS at anchorage areas to 
different vessel types and different port environments in different conditions (physical 
and operational) to optimise OPS deployment and investments.   
In addition, project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes:  
• Ship and port operators benefit from cost-efficient innovative solutions for flexible and 
mobile OPS for ships at shore or OPS at anchorage areas, for Low and High Voltage 
installations beyond the deployment actions taking place to meet the requirements of 
FuelEU Maritime and AFIR set by 2030, towards the policy goals set by 2050.  
• Terminal and ship operators have available mature mobile and flexible OPS or OPS at 
anchorage solutions applicable to the different ship types and services and port 
environments, with a special consideration to safety explosive atmospheres and 
dangerous zones; 
• Ship and port operators have standards, protocols and/or solutions aiming to bridge the 
gaps identified during the project for the implementation of fast charging as well as 
mobile and flexible OPS or OPS at anchorage areas; 
• Ship operators, grid managers and energy suppliers have solutions to prevent electrical 
failures and for earthing monitoring, with a particular focus on OPS mobile and flexible 
solutions or OPS at anchorage areas.   
Scope: OPS solutions currently available in the market, while conforming to standards, have 
gaps in terms of flexibility and modularity, in particular regarding the expected future demand 
in terminals with a high turnover of diverse waterborne traffic served. OPS port infrastructure

solutions so far are static or have limited flexibility at the berth, whereby several static 
connections are needed to cover port requirements. As an alternative or supplement, further 
research is needed in OPS solutions that allow OPS to be provided within and across different 
terminals and port areas. Solutions developed under this topic should be generally applicable, 
so they can be used for several types of vessels. However, the solutions should consider the 
special features of the different ship types and services, such as the safety requirements for 
tanker and chemicals traffic where connectivity in complex environments is an issue. 
Following Fit-for-55 OPS requirements in AFIR and FuelEU Maritime, new Onshore Power 
Supply products are being developed, including High-Voltage OPS systems, within a 
framework of robust standardisation. However, further research is needed on the mature, 
flexible and safe provision of OPS at anchorage and in a flexible way along different 
terminals and port areas through technologies other than barges, applicable to a wide range of 
ports with different geographies and conditions. 
The development of solutions to simultaneously provide OPS, fast battery charging as well as 
loading operations needs further standardisation and dedicated protocols. Standardisation of 
fast battery charging is underway; therefore, proposals are encouraged to explore relevant 
research for fast battery charging beyond the current or soon to be adopted standards (e.g., 
IEC/EEE 80005-4) to be implemented in the developed solutions for OPS at anchorage or 
mobile and flexible OPS. 
Proposals should address all the following aspects:   
1. Demonstrate innovative scalable OPS solutions as described in the expected outcomes, 
addressing either Area A or Area B.  
2. Minimise the risk of system failure and ensuring continuous operation, resilient to 
adverse climate conditions; 
3. Identify remaining gaps in standardisation for the solutions developed and define 
recommendations for standards, protocols and/or solutions at least for safe fast battery 
charging. Projects addressing Area B should also address these activities for load/unload 
cargo operations simultaneously; 
4. Research into systems that can simultaneously provide fast battery charging and OPS; 
5. Development of earthing protection solutions through monitoring of the grounding 
resistance to predict failure; 
6. All solutions should align with the optimisation of onboard High Voltage transformers, 
automation of onboard connection systems, optimisation of onboard OPS switchboard 
operation, and onboard safety monitoring systems and blackout prevention/mitigation 
systems to synchronise process and the communication between ship and shore; 
7. Adequate training and support for crew and port staff are crucial for the successful 
implementation and operation of the solutions developed training programs should

energy used in propulsion of ships directly into calculations of GHG intensity of the 
energy used on-board, both in context of Fuel EU maritime and International Maritime 
Organization (IMO) Life Cycle assessment (LCA) guidelines; 
• Provision of a standardised framework to ensure certainty in the claims regarding fuel, 
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) and other polluting emission reduction by Wind-Assisted 
Propulsion (WAP) systems, strengthening the implementation of the FuelEU Maritime 
Regulation; 
• Uniform rules, regulations, assessment criteria, and sea-trial procedures for WAP 
solutions are explored and established, facilitating the market uptake of WAP systems; 
• Standardisation efforts to implement the IMO Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) guidelines 
are supported; 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 218 of 313 
• Market uptake of WAP systems into existing vessels in the coming decade is facilitated, 
by introducing a set of standardised design alternatives and criteria for decision-making, 
as part of a standardised framework; 
• Concerns about the safety and operational impacts on ships, port and other land 
infrastructure are addressed, as well as the lack of market confidence in the technology; 
• Contribution to the competitiveness and strategic autonomy of the EU waterborne sector, 
in line with the Communication on European Economic Security Strategy. The EU 
waterborne industry, including shipyards and equipment manufacturers will gain an 
increased competitive advantage through the development of key and cost-effective 
solutions for WAP systems.   
Scope: WAP systems (e.g., rotor sails, rigid wing sails, soft wing sails, ventilated foil system, 
etc.) have gained significant attention as means of reducing ship fuel consumption, and GHG 
and other emissions, while they are also considered as primary means of propulsion for future 
newbuilt cases. Several ongoing EU-funded projects are already working on WAP systems 
with focus on holistic optimised ship design, control, and operation, including changes in 
conventional propeller propulsion, and focused on Deep Sea Shipping (DSS). However, there 
is still a variety of barriers and challenges that need to be addressed; the main challenges are 
to provide certainty on emission saving performance, define standards, while also facilitating 
WAP retrofitting. The aim of the topic is to develop a methodology that will allow to quantify 
and monitor the real impact of WAP systems into ship propulsion. 
Proposals are expected to address all of the following aspects: 
• Demonstration of at least one full scale WAP solution and its management and 
monitoring on-board. This demonstration will be used to also validate the methodology 
for integration of the energy provided by the WAP devices to the ship propulsion; 
• Develop a holistic framework for the design optimisation for wind-assisted propulsion, 
either as a means of enhanced energy efficiency, or primary propulsion solution; the 
framework should work as design tool to facilitate the industry uptake of WAP 
technologies by introducing tailor-made solutions for various ship types, based on their 
operational profiles and navigation routes; 
• Use of systems for advanced monitoring of energy consumption, performance 
optimisation, energy savings, mitigation of GHG and other polluting emissions. The 
project should make optimal use of state-of-the-art sensor and digital technologies with a 
view to achieve continuous monitoring of energy made available from WAP devices; 
methodology should cover various types of WAP and should be applicable for all types 
of ships and operations; 
• Assessment of environmental and wider benefits, including reduced emissions of air and 
water pollutants, underwater noise, biodiversity as well as cost-effectiveness for either 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025

Part 8 - Page 219 of 313 
standalone WAP solutions or combinations with other low and zero-emission 
technologies and/or energy efficiency measures; 
• Focus on safety and operational aspects, for addressing any technical and operational 
challenges that may arise from the introduction of WAP systems – and possible 
combinations with other energy efficiency solutions – for ships and ports, including 
other land infrastructure; 
• Addressing scalability and adaptability issues to the existing fleet, such as efforts to 
promote the standardisation of the different solutions, and application of the solution 
considering the real environmental conditions and the impact of climate change in wind 
patterns; 
• Examine a variety of business cases and propose a number of market measures to 
address the lack of market confidence in WAP solutions and the uptake of such systems 
in the maritime industry.   
Proposals are expected to explain the contribution of their objectives, results, IP management 
and exploitation strategy to the EU added value creation and strategic autonomy throughout 
the supply and value chain, including competitiveness of the EU waterborne industry, 
enhancement of the EU’s R&I capacity, technological know-how capabilities and human 
capital, and resilience of the EU industrial and manufacturing base.. Proposals are encouraged 
to prioritise shipyards, equipment manufacturers and suppliers located in the EU and EEA. 
This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Zero Emission 
Waterborne Transport’ (ZEWT). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected 
to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Zero Emission Waterborne Transport’ 
(ZEWT) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.

Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025). 217. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project’s results are expected to contribute to all the following expected 
outcomes: 
• EU Fuel producers, fuel infrastructure developers and bunkering facilities will jointly 
benefit from the creation of relevant business models that will accelerate the deployment 
of renewable and low carbon fuels for waterborne transport. 
• EU Fuel producers will become more competitive in the production of renewable and 
low carbon fuels for waterborne transport. 
• Significant increase of pipeline projects supported by various programmes and 
institutions in relation to renewable and low carbon fuels production and usage. 
• Developing a diverse portfolio of scientifically sound mature proposals for the 
deployment of technological solutions to reduce Greenhouse Gas emissions, in line with 
the EU climate targets, especially taking into account the Fitfor55 package. 
• Added value creation and increased competitiveness within the EU waterborne transport 
fuel ecosystem.   
Scope: The European Commission is currently involved in several initiatives that aim to 
accelerate the deployment of solutions relevant for the market uptake of renewable and low 
carbon fuels. Firstly, following the initiative from the Commission, the EU has adopted 
FuelEU Maritime Regulation, which sets the binding reduction targets for GHG intensity of 
energy used on board for maritime vessels. As a flanking measure to this regulation, the 
Commission has promoted the Renewable and Low Carbon Fuel Alliance, which 
encompasses a large portion of all fuel producers, with the goal to facilitate the investment in 
renewable and low carbon fuels for waterborne and aviation, aiming to clarify feedstock 
availability, demand, and supply forecast, and to promote a commercial pipeline of projects.  
The Revised ETS directive has put shipping under the umbrella of ETS with corresponding 
revenues to be allocated to green shipping projects. Consequently, the Commission is 
preparing the first dedicated calls under the Hydrogen Bank, focusing on maritime 
applications.

In the context of international collaboration, the Commission is currently working, together 
with the Joint Research Centre, on a study about the Global Gateway Green Shipping 
Corridors (GGGSC). This report aims to identify ports outside of the EU of strategic interest 
to the bloc that can be part of such corridors and to aggregate them into corridors that meet a 
combination of policy priorities. In this context, the Commission will also look into possible 
actions to support partner countries to ensure the availability of renewable and low carbon 
fuels within the selected ports. 
In addition, the Commission has published a number of studies, including on the 
“Development of outlook for the necessary means to build industrial capacity for drop-in 
advanced biofuels”218 and has published a call for a second tender for a study on “How to 
mobilize industrial capacity building for advanced biofuels”219. The EIB published the study 
“Financing sustainable liquid fuel projects in Europe: Identifying barriers and overcoming 
them” in May 2024. In addition Horizon Europe includes a call "HORIZON-CL5-2024-D3-
02-13: Support to the activities of the SET Plan Key Action area Renewable fuels and 
bioenergy”, with deadline in February 2025. Advanced biofuels are also an option for 
renewable energy supply in waterborne transport. Furthermore, under topic HORIZON-CL5-
2023-D2-01-07: Support for the deployment of R&I results for climate mitigation, five 
coordination and support actions have been selected. Synergies should be drawn in relation 
with the Innovation Fund program. 
Projects are expected to take the previous initiatives as a starting point and go beyond their 
conclusions. In particular, they must address all of the following aspects: 
• Provide project development support to at least 20 proposals220 within the renewable and 
low carbon fuel ecosystem for waterborne transport in order to increase the number of 
applications in programmes such as Horizon Europe and its successor, Innovation Fund, 
CEF AFIF and schemes such as EIB Loans, structural funds, as well as initiatives at 
national and regional level and at international level within the Global Gateway strategy. 
The proposal should consider coordination of their activities with already existing EU 
project assistance providers such as the EIB Advisory project development assistance 
scheme, avoiding duplication. Proposals will propose KPIs in relation with additional 
projects and activities to be performed thanks to its action. The support to projects 
should be provided following a competitive selection process, prioritizing projects 
admitted to the RLCF Alliance Project Pipeline and/or Global Gateway. The proposal 
shall elaborate on project selection methodology. 
• Creation of an analytical financial tool which allows users to model a project and 
understand the economic rational of a business case and identify those assumptions, 
drivers and barriers which are critical to ensuring that the underlying projects are 
financially and economically viable. The projects for which the analytical tool will be

developed are those which produce renewable and low carbon fuels necessary for the 
sustainable goals of the waterborne transport sector, as defined in the Green Deal, 
especially by ensuring a wide European geographical coverage in the EU. These models 
must take into account the results delivered through the Roundtable 4 of the RLCF 
Alliance in their financial analysis. The models will aim to preserve the industrial 
competitiveness of the EU industry, in alignment with RED, FuelEU maritime and ETS, 
also considering any potential unlevelled playing field risks/challenges vis-a-vis other 
countries outside the European Union. These models will examine the scalability 
potential of the fuel considering production, transport and distribution, security of supply 
in ports in and outside Europe, GHG emission saving on Well to Wake basis, distance 
continuously sailed on the fuel, size of ship in terms of installed power, total distance 
sailed and transparency on the project costs. Additionally, these models will also aim to 
leverage potential synergies between RFNBOs and advanced biofuels technologies 
development should be identified and utilized for the benefit of both pathways. 
Appropriate linkage to the RLCF Alliance is encouraged. 
• In collaboration with the RLCF Alliance, develop and conduct a series of 
workshops/trainings with financial institutions and relevant waterborne stakeholders to 
facilitate the market uptake of waterborne and renewable and low carbon fuel production 
solutions for waterborne transport, with a particular attention to the access to capital for 
demonstration projects with a higher technological risk profile and dissemination of best 
practices to access financing and funding. The project will need to carry out relevant 
dissemination activities to communicate the results of the project to all relevant policy 
makers as well as stakeholders from the industry and civil society.

Expected Outcome: To support the Zero Pollution Action Plan and the Smart and Sustainable 
Mobility Strategy as well as the implementation of the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities 
Mission, project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: 
• Real-time demonstration of on-board tamper-proof and remote measurement techniques 
for a wide range of pollutants (including pollutants from alternative fuels and non-
regulated pollutants) from vessel emissions, allowing shipowners to measure the 
emissions during operation and contributing to the current monitoring and enforcing 
activities of public authorities, such as port and maritime authorities and with the 
potential to be used for future compliance monitoring; 
• Development of broadly accepted harmonised methods to measure real sailing 
emissions, including coastal, open seas and inland waterway with potential to be used for 
future compliance monitoring; 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 224 of 313 
• Development of an automatic reporting and verification system solution that helps 
shipping companies to comply with current and future regulation and for maritime, 
inland and port authorities to monitor and control the actual ship emissions derived from 
the data exchanged; 
• Contribution to the delivery of better emission factors for emissions inventories and 
projections, especially for harmful substances and fuel mixtures for which little 
knowledge exists today and ultimately contributing to the establishment of a broadly 
accepted method for measuring and calculating real sailing emissions of a ship; 
• Identification of real-world releases of harmful substances which are currently not 
controlled by regulations and excessive releases of substances already controlled in open 
seas and in-port activities; 
• Innovative technologies and systems to monitor, measure and identify the source of 
pollution in ports beyond vessels, including other transport modes, port operations and 
industries active in the port environment are made available for public authorities; 
• Recommendations for improved certification and testing to better cover real world 
situations; 
• Support of local, regional, national and international emissions reduction and air quality 
plans and noise action plans by providing real-world emission information and 
measuring the actual impact of control measures and strategies on concentrations and/or 
deposition of pollutants; 
• Identification of risk areas for potential violations to emission limits.   
Scope: There is a pressing need to measure accurately the different types of emissions in 
coastal and port environments located near to cities, because of their negative impact on the 
environment and human health. Ports, as intricate environments showcasing a variety of 
vessels including novel designs, pose a challenge to the development of standardised 
technologies capable of collecting and assessing real-time pollutant emissions data from these 
ships docking at ports. This is vital for enforcing emissions limits and validating the data for 
enforcement purposes. 
Moreover, emissions in ports stem from other sources, such as port operations (e.g., cargo 
handling, towing, fuel storage, and bunkering) or even other industrial activities (directly or 
indirectly linked to transport, e.g., fisheries) taking place within the port area. Additionally, 
ports are frequently situated near industrial zones, making it crucial to possess an accurate 
and, where possible, real-time understanding of the types, origins, and intensity of pollutant 
and noise emissions generated in and around a port area.

The shift from heavy fuel oils to alternative fuels in the context of the regulatory 
framework221 set to achieve the objectives of the Green Deal requires further research actions; 
recent evidence from research and monitoring projects has shown that new fuels being 
considered and GHG emission-control technologies used on-board vessels may result in 
emissions of other harmful pollutants that are not sufficiently controlled. In some cases, 
unexpected side effects of emission abatement may arise which might require regulatory 
action222. 
Further to such undesired releases, it is crucial to ensure that vessels comply with regulations 
in force, in coastal areas, at open sea and in inland waterways. Projects under call LC-MG-1-
1-2018 of Horizon 2020 showed that remote measurement of SOx emissions using stationary 
or mobile techniques can significantly increase the cost-effectiveness of compliance 
monitoring. It is important to explore whether remote or on-board techniques can be extended 
to the monitoring of additional pollutants such as CH4, NOx, N2O, NH3, UFP, BC, 
formaldehyde, PM 223 , as well as the Particle Number (PN), NPAHs and to provide 
internationally harmonised methods and reporting procedures where such measurements can 
be used within an enhanced compliance monitoring framework in the future. These methods 
should also have the potential to be used as evidence for law enforcement to enable 
independent prosecution of violations. Furthermore, there is a need to develop engine testing 
procedures that better represent operational patterns in order for the emission values from test 
cycles to accurately represent real emissions. 
Limited surveillance measurements at open seas show a different compliance (lower 
compliance) behaviour for sulphur emissions compared to measurements in coastal regions. 
Therefore, it is important to identify risk areas for violations and to establish techniques for 
monitoring in these areas as well. It is of equally great importance to develop 
harmonised/standardised monitoring methods that could be used as evidence for sanctions in 
the future. 
Assessment of the real-world performance of emission control, in particular for Tier III 
vessels, is therefore required to make sure that current NOx regulations achieve and sustain 
the emission reductions that these regulations are designed for. Further, certification testing 
should be modified to better address real world conditions. Moreover, potential ammonia slip 
 
221 
The IMO's 2023 GHG Strategy targets net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping 
by 2050, with interim goals for 2030 and 2040. Measures include the adoption of lower-carbon fuels 
such as methanol and ammonia. In the EU, initiatives like FuelEU Maritime and ETS inclusion will 
drive this transition while regulations address harmful emissions like sulphur and nitrogen oxides, with 
Tier III NOx limits enforced. Discussions also focus on Black Carbon emissions in the Arctic and 
health impacts of ultrafine particles. 
222 
For example, evidence shows that the introduced Tiers may not be effective in controlling NOx 
emissions in real vessel operation, scrubbers may result in the formation of new ultra-fine particles, 
ammonia combustion potentially leads to the formation of nitrous oxide and ammonia slip, methanol 
combustion may lead to the production of formaldehyde, LNG may result in the slip of methane, etc. 
Obviously, any strategy targeting the control of GHG or air pollutants should not result in negative side-
effects such as the release of harmful pollutants which are today not covered by regulations.

from urea consumption needs to be identified, and N2O emission levels need to be determined 
to ensure that GHG reduction efforts are not thwarted. 
In addition, no established method for identifying NOx emissions that exceed existing 
standards under real sailing operation is currently in place. Based on different remote or on-
board measurement techniques, harmonised methods, and reporting procedures to identify 
exceedances of expected emission levels needs to be designed and put in action, at least for 
informative reasons – as no enforcement of low NOx under real operation is currently in 
place. 
With CH4 being a potent GHG, any uncontrolled releases from LNG powered vessels 
significantly compromise any lower carbon benefits of the LNG as a fuel. Moreover, although 
boil-off gas (BOG) should be reliquefied or used on-board, records of BOG release to the 
atmosphere have been reported. The extent of any remaining current problem needs to be 
identified and measurements on methane slip from actual vessels need to identify the extent of 
emissions, considering potential needs for methane emission limits (for the engines as well as 
for the fuel storage onboard and the bunkering process). The problem with methane slip will 
also remain with the use of bio-methane as fuel. 
New fuels are considered in the effort to decarbonise shipping, with the most prominent being 
ammonia (NH3), methanol (MeOH) and hydrogen. There is currently limited evidence on new 
pollution dimensions induced by such fuels, including ultrafine particles of non-carbonaceous 
origin, N2O and NH3 emissions, NPAH, Formaldehyde PM, NOx, etc. Measurements on 
actual marine engines and vessels using such fuels need to provide new evidence in the pool 
of data forming so that early measures are taken before such new fuels become widespread in 
actual use, in case such new emissions prove to be at a level that constitute health hazards or 
environmental risks. Zero carbon fuels like NH3 and H2, as well as dual-fuel engines and CO2 
capture onboard require different remote measurement methods, since CO2 is no longer a 
stable and dominant reference gas in the exhaust plume. Alternative options in sensing and 
calculation method need to be introduced. 
Demonstration must be undertaken within a real operational environment. In the collection 
and analysis of remote as well as static sensing data for the monitoring of emissions and air 
pollutants, the accuracy of the sensors and the quality and verifiability of the data obtained are 
of particular importance. Potential risks and problems in data collection and sensor 
technology, in particular as regards the identification of the source of the pollution, should be 
analysed in detail. A verifiable methodology is also required for processing and interpreting 
the data in the next step. Issues such as access to data, data storage and associated security 
aspects (including the assessment of cyber security of interoperable systems) should be fully 
considered. Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context 
of this topic is FAIR224. 
To address all these highlighted issues, proposals are expected to undertake all the following 
R&I activities: 
 
224 
Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable

• Map high emission activities and demonstrate port, coastal, inland and open sea 
monitoring techniques for at least NOx, BC, N2O, UFP, NH3, CH4,, PM as well as PN 
and NMVOC (or any other related pollutants), during normal operation of ships which 
includes dynamic engine loads of all ship types (including port service vessels) and 
suitable for zero carbon fuels, dual-fuel engines and carbon capture. All the emission 
measurements should be integrated through static and remote sensing in order to share 
data; 
• Demonstration of the developed measuring technologies in 6 different TEN-T ports, (of 
which 3 Core and 3 Comprehensive ports, covering at least three sea basins of the Black, 
Mediterranean, North Sea, N. Atlantic and Baltic Seas). Out of these 6 ports at least one 
should be classified as a TEN-T inland-waterway only port according to Annex II of the 
TEN-T Regulation. At least one of the ports should be situated in a city participating in 
the Cities Mission and activities should feed into the implementation of the Climate City 
Contract (CCC), with abatement measures and port-city collaborative governance 
approaches to match or enhance CCC commitments. The selection of ports should be 
such as to cover a wide range of emission profiles and take into consideration the 
complexity of emission sources in order to ensure that the outcome is representative and 
can be replicated to other ports; 
• Identify, differentiate and measure in real time at or near possible sources of emissions 
(e.g., individual vessel, specific port operations, industrial installations within and very 
close to the port area) under complex (geographical, layout, mixed space uses and other) 
conditions and variable weather conditions. The calibration of the measurement systems 
and the reproducibility of the results should be demonstrated; 
• Development of a methodology for assessing pollution within the port area including 
emissions from all transport modes, port operations and industries located in the port 
area; 
• Identify the impact of emissions in ports and nearby cities and propose mitigating 
measures and plans for municipalities and port authorities, including ports in which 
municipalities are not directly involved in the management of port authorities and 
terminals; 
• Development of Real-Time Decision Support Systems (RT DSS) for ships, onboard ship 
operations, ship operators to look into data collected to enable port and maritime 
authorities to make decisions about rebates; 
• Development of harmonised monitoring techniques and an automatic reporting and 
verification system solution helping shipowners to comply with current and future EU 
and international regulation as well as public authorities to monitor and control 
emissions from the data exchanged; 
• Harmonise/standardise monitoring techniques and reporting (taking also into 
consideration the CountEmissions EU rules) with the potential to be used for legal

prosecution; develop recommendations for improved certification and testing for real 
world situations; 
• Increase evidence to feed pool of data for regulated and non-regulated pollutants from 
vessels; 
• Identify pollutants from new fuels used for shipping decarbonisation; 
• Develop protocol(s) for the measurement of BC, UFP, and PN from vessels; 
• Develop engine testing methods to better mimic real-world emissions and propose a 
vessel grading system methodology with respect to its emissions comparable to EURO 
classification of road vehicles.   
Proposals should demonstrate how they will engage with authorities and local communities in 
disseminating results in proportion to their expected impacts. Relevant authorities include the 
European Commission, the Bonn Agreement, Helcom, the IMO, and national, regional, and 
local competent authorities etc. while local communities are primarily, but not limited to, 
major port cities and coastal areas in the EU. 
Proposals are encouraged to explore and use the results from previous EU-funded projects 
such as SCIPPER (Horizon 2020), EMERGE (Horizon 2020) and Green C Ports (CEF), 
Interreg Clean North Sea Shipping and LIFE CLINSH (CLean Inland SHipping) as well as 
develop complementarities with relevant activities funded under the Horizon Europe call on 
“Advanced transport emissions monitoring networks” (HORIZON-CL5-2023-D5-01-18) and 
activities developing satellite-based measurements (Cluster 4 Destination 5 (Space) and 
EUSPA), focusing on remaining gaps not covered by these projects. Duplication of activities 
should be avoided. 
Proposals are encouraged to include and consider the fisheries sectors and fishing vessels, 
considering their potential intersections with the use of alternative fuels in ports when 
relevant. Consideration of projects such as HORIZON-MISS-2023-OCEAN-01-05 and 
PPPA-2024-FISHVESSELDEMO may prove beneficial.  
The funded projects should share their experience and good practices with the projects 
selected under the topic of the EU Ocean & Waters Mission on “Restoring waterfront cities 
and their ports /maritime infrastructures (HORIZON-MISS-2025-03-OCEAN-05) and links 
should also be established with the projects funded under topic HORIZON-CL4-SPACE-
2025-01-46: Innovative Earth observation services in support of maritime litter detection and 
ship source pollution policies.  
This topic has been co-programmed and is contributing to the implementation of the Zero-
Emission Waterborne Transport (ZEWT) partnership and of the Climate Neutral and Smart 
Cities Mission.

• More effective links and exchanges between research and innovation stakeholders, 
industry and policy makers, to support the development and deployment of innovative 
solutions in Europe and Associated Countries; 
• Increased attractiveness of transport related studies and reinforce the pursuit of 
excellence in European transport research and innovation, by giving recognition and 
visibility to the best achievements; 
• Increased visibility, interest and number of applications for the two competitions for 
transport research and innovation awards.   
Scope: The action will prepare and provide support to the Transport Research Arena (TRA) 
conference to be organised in 2028 gathering transport stakeholders for discussing political, 
industrial and research issues on a European and global level. 
Proposals are expected to demonstrate the financial and organisational support of the national 
authorities interested to host the event and an economic plan covering the additional funding 
needs. A professional conference organiser should be included in the consortium. To ensure 
high political and strategic relevance, the proposals should involve Member States holding the 
Presidency of the European Union in year 2028. 
In line with previous TRA biannual conferences, the event should address the technological 
and industrial developments of the transport sector (i.e., road, rail, waterborne, aviation 
sectors and cross-modal aspects) providing a high level, future-oriented perspective coming 
from politics, the industry and the research community, in response to Europe’s social needs 
and expectations. Specific attention should be put on a broad and balanced participation in the 
conference i.e., students, young researchers, women, a large number of country 
representatives, etc. 
The action will be implemented in close collaboration with the Management and Programme 
Committees of the TRA, which includes the TRA 2028 conference organiser, the European 
Commission services, the different European Technology Platforms (ERTRAC for road, 
ERRAC for rail, WATERBORNE TP for waterborne, ALICE for logistics and ACARE for 
aeronautics and ECTP for construction), the Conference of European Directors of Roads 
(CEDR), the European Transport Research Alliance (ETRA) and the previous TRA 
conference organiser (TRA 2026) in order to maintain continuity of the event. 
Proposals should address all the following aspects: 
• Support the definition of the overall planning of the conference, including the main 
thematic pillars of the event as well as the structuring of the technical and political 
sessions; 
• Contribute to the identification and selection of an appropriate conference venue and 
support the organisation of the conference’s logistics;

• Provide operational support to the TRA conference organisers, such as in relation to the 
website and conference management IT tools (e.g., for the registration of participants, 
handling of speakers’ contributions, submission and selection of scientific papers, 
conference application); 
• Support the organisation of the demonstration activities and technical visits; 
• Assess and monitor the environmental impact of the event and propose appropriate 
measures to reduce and mitigate this impact; 
• Organise of two high-quality competitions for transport research and innovation awards 
(TRA VISION) covering all transport modes and cross-cutting issues (technological, 
socio-economic, and behavioural aspects) in line with the EU policy objectives for 
climate-neutral and environmentally friendly mobility:        
 A competition for students and young researchers with the goal of stimulating the 
interest among young researchers/students to develop innovative solutions in the 
field of transport;     
 A competition for senior researchers in the field of innovative transport concepts 
based on results from EU-funded projects only.    
• Proposals should plan for involving the awarded researchers in the conference 
programme and for promoting links between the researchers and possible career 
development opportunities in the field (e.g., traineeships, jobs, courses, training);         
 A very good media coverage before, during and after the event should be foreseen 
for both the TRA conference and for the TRA VISIONS.

Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:  
• Comprehensive set of principles, guidelines and requirements for remote operations that 
clarify operational complexities (e.g., safety, (cyber-)security, liability, privacy, 
certification and operator training, interoperability, cross-border operations) is defined, 
and a standardised approach to extend the Operational Design Domain (ODD) of CCAM 
solutions is established; 
• Infrastructure prerequisites, particularly in technology and communications (safe and 
reliable communication, especially considering SNS components for the automotive 
sector228) are defined, which are critical for the successful implementation of remote 
operation capabilities, outlining the technical standards and investments necessary for 
seamless integration with current transport systems, while appreciating the potential 
environmental impact; 
• Safety validation methodologies extended to remote operations favouring acceptance 
and trust of road users in such CCAM systems; 
• Identification and description of at least two economically viable business cases for 
remote operations complementing the ODD of CCAM solutions, analysing the economic 
costs and benefits, market potential, and scalability factors, and providing a clear value 
proposition for public or private stakeholders for each use case; 
• Understanding the human factors of the entire system (including the in-vehicle and 
remote perspective), as well as legal requirements and working conditions for remote 
operators, addressing cognitive load, fatigue and stress, ergonomic considerations, and 
the identification of essential skills. Establishment of key conditions for job quality, 
safety, up-to-date competences and acceptance of working conditions in diverse cultural 
contexts; 
• Responsiveness to a deeper understanding of the needs and concerns of diverse social 
groups involved in or potentially affected by the R&I development, considering gender 
and other social categories, and thereby increasing the potential for beneficial societal 
uptake, and building trust in results and outcomes;

• Policy and governance recommendations in view of establishing new or updating 
existing legislation to cover remote operations, e.g., through clear descriptions of 
stakeholder roles and responsibilities that may vary for different types of remote 
operations.   
Scope: This topic aims at exploring the operational and societal conditions and prerequisites 
for complementing the ODD of CCAM solutions through remote operations, as defined by the 
United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE)229. Here “remote operations” is 
to be understood as the remote monitoring, assisting, and operating the Automated Driving 
System (ADS) by a person located externally. The vehicle operates with a high degree of 
automation (SAE Level 4), but a human operator can monitor its actions and surroundings 
remotely and intervene, if needed. Intervention ranges from providing strategic guidance and 
tactical commands to determining vehicle manoeuvres and taking over control in scenarios 
that include, but are not limited to, emergency responses, system malfunctions, ADS system 
limits, or complex navigational challenges unforeseen by the CCAM system. 
The topic invites proposals to explore two use cases that should focus on remote operations on 
urban and rural public roads and/ or confined areas, dealing with at least two of the following 
areas: 
• Transport of people: use cases that enhance public transport services (i.e., by fleets of 
remotely operated shared vehicles, including, if relevant, on-demand responsive 
transport) improving accessibility and mobility for users in all their diversity in terms of 
all characteristics (e.g., age, gender, disability, etc); 
• Transport of goods: use cases that optimise logistics (e.g., remotely operated delivery 
vehicles in urban environment), improving efficiency and sustainability; 
• Combination of people and goods transport: use cases of integrated solutions (e.g., 
remotely operated vehicles that transport goods during off-peak hours and convert into 
passenger transport services during peak times), improving vehicle utilisation, while 
addressing congestion and reducing environmental impact.  
For each of these use-cases, operational and societal aspects that would enable remote 
operations of multiple ADSs must be evaluated in terms of business models, infrastructure 
needs, safety assurance, legislation, as well as organisational aspects that may include cultural 
elements. Additionally, operator’s skills, performance and situational awareness of the remote 
operator must be addressed. The analysis of potential rebound effects and questions related to 
energy sufficiency and sustainability should not be neglected. Where applicable, the use of 
generative AI should be considered. 
This topic aims to understand all the different components of the complex ‘system-of-
systems’, combining technological advancements with a focus on human-centred design/ 
interfaces, as well as societal needs, considering their implications from the start. This will 
enable to lay the foundation for the development of advanced demonstrator use cases,

integrating the various components in next phases, although technological adaptations of 
existing approaches to reach an integrated system-of-systems should already be validated in 
the relevant environment here. 
Technological components of the system-of-system are foreseen to include e.g. infrastructure 
support, communications, cyber-security, key enabling technologies (possibly including 
generative AI, etc.). Proper selection of existing technology enablers and related SW 
developments to implement the remote operation functions is essential. Societal aspects must 
be identified (e.g., user-centric design, working conditions), through the inclusive engagement 
of stakeholders for problem formulation and concepts development, co-creation and co-
assessment of deployment and operations. 
Stakeholders could include user groups and public advocacy organisations, mobility 
companies, technology providers, public agencies, planners, community groups, industry 
associations, first responders, social partners230 and workforce representatives. These should 
be involved in building awareness, trust, and support for remote operations, identifying skill 
gaps and skill transferability of operators as well as training needs. Additionally, various 
stakeholders should be engaged to examine unanticipated implications (e.g., environmental, 
social equity etc.) and to co-develop solutions, as well as other pre-conditions making remote 
operations feasible (e.g., policy, governance, territorial planning, infrastructural readiness, 
integration into Traffic Management Systems (TMS), organisational and legislative 
requirements etc.). 
The dimensions of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) – reflection, inclusion, 
anticipation, and responsiveness – should guide the exploration of the technological 
components of the system-of-system to achieve societal readiness, involving relevant Social 
Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines (e.g., psychology, geography, Science and 
Technology Studies, sociology, ethics). 
The safety assurance of remote operations entails the development of a corresponding 
validation methodology, as the remote operator with the wireless communication system and 
the related interfaces becomes part of the system to be validated. Proposed actions shall 
develop the basic principles of such a methodology considering the framework provided by 
EU 2022/1426, building upon, to the extent possible, the results of the SUNRISE231 project 
and seeking close coordination with actions under HORIZON-CL5-2023-D6-01-02 232 , 
HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-02233 as well as HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-03234.

Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:  
• Pave the road for forthcoming CCAM deployment and deliver a comprehensive large-
scale demonstration plan for CCAM vehicles across Europe; 
• Ensure the engagement of key stakeholders across the value chain in transport and 
mobility, including required industrial partners (such as OEMs and suppliers) and a 
range of end users and service providers, in preparing for demonstrations that will pave 
the way for subsequent implementations; 
• Establish the foundation for future use case specific projects in different domains, such 
as public and private road transport and logistics, alongside the large-scale 
demonstrations; 
• Outline a CCAM promotion strategy, supporting elevated public engagement and 
awareness; 
• Responsiveness to a deeper understanding of the needs and concerns of diverse social 
groups involved in or potentially affected by the R&I development, thereby increasing 
the potential for beneficial societal uptake, and building trust in results and outcomes.   
Scope: In recent years, the work in vehicle automation has concentrated on technological 
advancements, human factors, extensive testing, and demonstrations to raise public awareness 
and facilitate market readiness. Even with the progress achieved, the challenges related to 
technical functionality as well as use, demand and affordability remain considerable. 
To tackle these challenges, a sensible approach is needed to implement vehicle automation 
developments in real-life applications via large-scale demonstrations such as Field 
Operational Tests (FOTs) within Living Labs. Additionally, particular use cases for public 
road transport and logistics should be targeted. The validation of technical enablers (also 
considering technological readiness), understanding user behaviour, promoting acceptance 
and advancing societal readiness for both mobility of people and transport of goods remains a 
major focus. The tests and large-scale demonstrations should be conducted in both mixed 
traffic conditions and confined areas, where applicable. Ensuring interoperability of 
connected automated systems across various vehicle brands, regions, and Member States is 
essential.

Since successful large-scale demonstration activities require strong and early engagement 
from key stakeholders, comprehensive planning and preparatory actions, leveraging previous 
and ongoing efforts, are needed to ensure European competitiveness and leadership. 
The action should leverage previous and ongoing projects at European and national levels on 
demonstration activities. It should consider the outcomes of the European software-defined 
vehicle of the future initiative. The frameworks and guidelines formulated by the CCAM 
Partnership shall be duly reflected237. This is to optimise the return on investments and create 
a strong basis for future large-scale demonstration projects to boost an industry-wide 
European deployment strategy for CCAM. 
Proposed actions for this topic are expected to address all of the following aspects: 
• Define the prerequisites for performing large-scale demonstration projects, considering 
vehicle technology maturity and other technical enablers, physical and digital 
infrastructures, as well as approval frameworks for public road testing; 
• Prepare and refine methodologies, test procedures and tools for the execution of field

• Identify test and demonstration sites across Europe for CCAM functions, considering the 
extension of Operational Design Domains (ODDs), using vehicular communication 
technologies (V2X) that enables Traffic Management Systems (TMS) for improved 
traffic flow and operational efficiency; 
• Initiate a cross-sector stakeholder forum for the definition of use case relevant projects in 
different domains and their implementation.   
The proposed action is expected to foster the collaboration between public and private 
stakeholders to achieve common objectives and assess societal impacts. Engagement of key 
stakeholders, covering the whole CCAM ecosystem, such as mobility and transport users, , 
public transport, shared mobility and logistics operators, infrastructure providers, traffic 
managers, public authorities, and research institutions must be ensured. In addition, European 
industrial players such as OEMs and suppliers should be adequately represented.  
This topic is a Societal-Readiness pilot:

Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:  
• Availability of validated prototypes of next-generation vehicle and infrastructure-based 
environment perception technologies for robust, reliable and trustworthy CCAM 
operations to anticipate and avoid foreseeable risks and unexpected safety-critical 
situations in complex real-world conditions (e.g., at pedestrian crossings, in construction 
sites, during interactions with emergency vehicles, etc.); 
• Understanding the degree (and limits) to which automated CCAM perception systems 
can anticipate, process, and respond to on-site ‘early-warnings’ (e.g., street design, 
sounds, smells and other signals from the environment, weather conditions, intentions of 
pedestrians, cyclists, and other active mobility users, etc.); 
• Improvement of the energy-efficiency of the sense-think-act systems of CCAM 
considering the vehicle, the infrastructure, the cloud at-the-edge, while at the same time 
increasing the performance to guarantee security and error-free reliability; these 
developments will contribute to the reduction of the potential climate and environmental 
footprints of CCAM systems; 
• Standardisation and adoption of modular, reusable, and upgradable software and 
hardware platforms, investigating scalable deployment concepts that lead to cost 
reduction and improved affordability while adopting a circular, eco-design approach 
(including efficient materials use, reduced waste, and the repair and reuse of components 
where feasible).   
Scope: The initial deployment of Level 4 automated vehicle services in urban and other 
complex settings has encountered significant challenges in environmental perception and 
decision-making, leading to occasional remote assistance calls, blockages and accidents that 
have impacted public trust. At the same time, the increasing computing power demand is in 
conflict with a limited usage of energy and resources to meet sustainability requirements. 
Thus, emerging large-scale demonstrations of automated vehicles should be accompanied by 
objective-oriented research aimed at addressing these challenges directly, while targeting 
improvements in performance, accuracy, reliability, and cyber-security. 
To successfully overcome these challenges, proposed actions for this topic are expected to 
address all of the following aspects:

• Advancements in all steps of the sense-control-act process for both vehicle- and 
infrastructure-based smart sensor systems and networks, controllers, and actuators to 
ensure safety and trustworthiness of CCAM, as well as facilitating effective disruption 
management; 
• Utilisation of digital enabling technologies including, for example: AI at-the-edge, 
machine learning, data spaces with reference scenarios and suitable software 
architectures242; 
• Adoption of modular, reusable, and open software platforms supporting the environment 
perception for CCAM while ensuring transparency of operation, verification, and safety 
assessment to build trust, with respect to authorities, decision makers and the public via 
direct performance explainability; 
• Energy efficiency, circularity, and eco-design of the environment perception systems by 
decreasing potential energy and resource consumption in both production and operation 
as well as facilitating reusability, reparability and upgradability while further enhancing 
the performance; 
• Reduction of potential costs of environment perception systems through scalability, 
modularity and standardisation, making technologies financially viable for widespread 
implementation; 
• Support remote assistance as a stepping-stone towards higher levels of autonomy and 
vehicle automation in wider Operational Design Domains (ODD).   
Solutions are expected to integrate electronic hardware architectures and software stacks in a 
co-design approach. Hence, it is strongly encouraged that solutions use, as far as possible, 
building blocks and tools from projects of the Software-Defined Vehicle of the Future 
(SDVoF) initiative under the Chips Joint Undertaking, e.g., on the hardware abstraction layer 
and SDV middleware and API framework. Results from projects funded under HORIZON-
CL5-2024-D6-01-04243 and complementarities with projects funded under Horizon Europe 
Cluster 4 “Digital Industry and Space” should also be considered, where appropriate. 
As the activities should demonstrate feasibility and their full potential for real-world 
applications, proposals should foresee exchanges with other relevant EU or national projects 
for e.g., coordinated validation, transport systems integration and large-scale piloting. 
Collaboration should also be sought with projects funded under HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-

accessibility, inclusiveness as well as regulation, proposals should consider societal, ethical, 
socio-economical and/ or legal aspects as far as feasible in the requirements of the technical 
solutions to be developed. This could involve the engagement of institutional users as well as 
citizen-science approaches, e.g., in collaboration with projects CulturalRoad245 and Diversify 
– CCAM246. 
To achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is highly relevant, considering 
the lessons learned in this area (for example, from robo-taxi and freight transport trials in the 
US and China). Activities should foster links between the European ecosystem and relevant 
stakeholders around the world, in particular with Japan and the United States but also with 
other relevant strategic partners in third countries, while taking into account the legal, 
cultural, historical, and social aspects in Europe as well as other specificities of the European 
road network and cities (including: traffic rules, user behaviour, diverse user groups 
considering gender, age, disability, socio-economic status, streets morphology, and the 
structure and condition of roads in rural areas).

Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes:  
• Validated human behavioural models representing the variety of human driving 
behaviour in safety-relevant scenarios, shared through a common repository and to be 
used:        
 to define pass criteria/ assessment criteria for CCAM systems in type approval 
schemes, consumer testing campaigns and industrial development processes;     
 to design safe, human-like behaviour of CCAM systems that can be anticipated 
easily by all road users and is acceptable to both CCAM vehicle occupants and all 
road users.    
• Application of such human behavioural models in the virtual safety validation of CCAM 
systems to realistically represent the behaviour of human-driven vehicles in closed loop 
simulations of mixed traffic, thereby reflecting the variety of human driving behaviour, 
including behaviour in complex real-world and emergency conditions.   
Scope: The deployment of CCAM systems in mixed traffic will mean intense interaction with 
all road users such as the human drivers of other vehicles as well as pedestrians and riders of 
two-wheelers. These interactions (including implicit and explicit communication by humans 
and CCAM systems) will play a crucial role in the acceptance and thereby the penetration of 
CCAM systems in future road transport. CCAM systems will have to show safe and human-
like driving behaviour, so that their decisions and actions can be anticipated easily by all road 
users, respecting the variety of typical driving behaviour across different countries as well as 
the need for CCAM systems to respect traffic rules and support road safety.

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025

Part 8 - Page 248 of 313 
This will require validated models of explicit and implicit human driving behaviour to design 
and validate such system behaviour. These models will be needed in closed loop simulations 
of CCAM systems in mixed traffic to realistically represent the reactions of human drivers in 
other vehicles to the behaviour of a CCAM system. Models representing human driving 
behaviour are being developed by the projects i4Driving249 and BERTHA250 for selected 
fields of application, i.e. they will be calibrated for a limited number of scenarios. Bringing 
together and building upon the results of these projects – in particular a simulation library and 
an innovative methodology to account for uncertainty from i4Driving and a scalable, 
probabilistic driver behavioural model from BERTHA, research is needed to extend the fields 
of application that these projects are addressing with a focus on representing driver behaviour 
in a multitude of safety-critical scenarios, considering the variation and statistical distribution 
of human behavioural patterns and the factors influencing such behaviour, including the 
parallel execution of non-driving related tasks. 
To achieve high degrees of robustness and applicability in a wide range of scenarios, detailed 
calibration and parameterisation is necessary, as driver behaviour depends on factors such as 
the road infrastructure, vehicle types, traffic conditions and rules, as well as regional 
influences and driver experiences / demographics, e.g., gender, age and other relevant social 
variables. Considering the deviation of average from ideal human driving behaviour, proposed 
actions must also validate the models for their extended fields of application, going well 
beyond the applications and degrees of validation accomplished by the above-mentioned 
projects under HORIZON-CL5-2022-D6-01-03. Proposed actions are thus expected to raise 
the technology readiness of such models to TRL 5. Data for parameterisation and validation 
should be captured by monitoring real human drivers in driving simulators and/or real traffic 
considering what is happening inside and outside the vehicle. 
Proposed actions should integrate, to the extent possible, the validated models in the virtual 
validation and verification approaches as developed in the projects HEADSTART 251 and 
SUNRISE252 and complemented by the project SYNERGIES253. Successful integration should 
be demonstrated in various safety-relevant scenarios as provided by the action(s) funded 
under HORIZON-CL5-2023-D6-01-02254. Models should be shared via the federated data 
exchange platform for CCAM to be developed by an action under HORIZON-CL5-2025-D6-
06255. 
Proposals are encouraged to also explore additional fields of application of validated driver 
behaviour models, while the integration of relevant expertise from social sciences and 
humanities (SSH) is expected.

Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• CCAM solutions - in hardware and software - with reduced power consumption, latency, 
and improved speed and accuracy, as domain specific adaptions of sector agnostic 
advancements in e.g. AI and/or cloud-edge-IoT technologies; 
• Enhanced levels of safety, (cyber) security, privacy and ethical standards of data-driven 
CCAM functionalities by using e.g. edge-AI applications for CCAM; 
• Approaches for well-balanced distributions of AI calculations for expanding use cases 
(e.g. collective perception, decision making and actuation) for connected, cooperative 
and automated driving applications (using a balanced mix of edge-based solutions, 
cloud-enabled solutions and vehicle-central solutions), balancing speed and latency, 
energy use, costs, data sharing and storage needs and availability; 
• Validated approaches incorporating edge-AI solutions into the action chain from 
perception and decision-making up to actuation of advanced CCAM functionalities - 
both on-board and on the infrastructure side - for systemic applications such as traffic 
management and remote control, as well as tools and approaches for training of such 
functionalities, which require optimised and verified edge-AI models.   
Scope: CCAM-enabled vehicles are constantly sensing their surroundings on road conditions, 
location, nearby vehicles and infrastructure. Such data is shared in real-time, while data from 
other sources is received. This needs powerful and optimised large data processing 
algorithms, which requires large amounts of computing power, data processing, real-time 
operation and high levels of security. However, most existing AI computing tasks for 
automated vehicle applications are relying on general-purpose hardware, which has 
limitations in terms of power consumption, speed, accuracy, scalability, memory footprint, 
size and cost. Hardware advancements driven by initiatives such as the Chips JU calls must be 
complemented by significant efforts to optimise AI algorithms for CCAM functionalities, 
ensuring their efficient performance on edge-specific hardware. 
To encompass CCAM solutions in future steps towards e.g., the Software Defined Vehicle, 
this dual approach on AI advancements and hardware advancements is essential.

Horizon Europe should also be considered where appropriate, especially in translating sector-
agnostic innovations to the specificities of CCAM applications. Requirements on AI 
algorithm optimisation, latency, on-board energy availability, solutions to gain unbiased 
datasets for AI training, Electronic Control Unit (ECU) capacity and on potential safety-
critical scenarios should be considered to ensure the timely triggering of actions, and in a later 
stage, anticipatory driving. Solutions should use, as far as possible, building blocks, 
interfaces, and tools from projects of the Software-Defined Vehicle of the Future (SDVoF) 
initiative. 
Edge-AI involves deploying AI algorithms on edge computing devices, which are hardware 
systems constrained in proximity to the data source where they operate. This is done without 
relying on remote resources for the computational efforts. It thus facilitates real-time insights, 
responses and triggering of actions, with reduced costs as the processing power close to the 
application is used, greatly reducing networking costs. Combining AI with edge-AI can 
facilitate stable solutions to include the full activity chain from sensing, perception, decision-
making up to actuation of advanced CCAM solutions, gaining speed and resilience which are 
essential in safety-critical situations. 
To successfully overcome these challenges, proposed actions are expected to address all of 
the following aspects: 
• For next major advancements in AI applications in CCAM solutions, huge AI 
applications need to fit into limited hardware, to make it fit for purpose. Edge-AI devices 
often have limited computational resources, making it challenging to deploy large and 
complex AI models. Thus, it is essential to develop and reshape approaches and building 
blocks for CCAM solutions, viable to be run on edge-hardware. Use cases for the 
approaches and building blocks should focus on time-critical applications (such as the 
chain from (collective) perception, decision making and actuation of functionalities) and 
can be linked to the activities and results from projects AI4CCAM258 and AIthena259. 
• Develop optimised edge-AI algorithms and demonstrate their applicability and 
scalability, using real-world CCAM scenarios such as in the databases resulting from 
projects such as SYNERGIES260. The development and demonstration use case should 
include in-vehicle perception and understanding, such as object detection, segmentation, 
road surface tracking, sign and signal recognition, etc. Decision making and actuation of 
countermeasures is to be part of the chain of actions. The approaches for these building 
blocks and enabling technologies should facilitate a quick uptake in adjacent or 
following projects; 
• Optimisation of the models for edge deployment. This involves adjusting the size and 
complexity of models to allow it to run on the relevant edge devices and include training 
and verification approaches. Techniques such as model quantization, pruning, and

knowledge distillation can be used to reduce the size of AI models without significant 
loss in performance. Additionally, over-the-air (OTA) updates can be used to manage 
and update models across a fleet of devices efficiently; 
• Develop tools and approaches for edge-AI model monitoring, to ensure that edge-AI 
systems continue to operate as expected and ensure resilience to failure conditions or 
attacks, and monitoring model outputs to ensure they are accurate even as real-life 
conditions and datasets change.  
The research will require due consideration of cyber security, connectivity and both personal 
and non-personal data protection rules, including compliance with the GDPR, and ensure that 
gender and other social categories (such as but not limited to disability, age, socioeconomic 
status, ethnic or racial origin, sexual orientation, etc.), and their intersections are duly 
considered where appropriate, as well as Explainable AI to enhance trust and regulatory 
compliance including alignment with the AI Act. 
In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged in 
particular with Japan and the United States but also with other relevant strategic partners in 
third countries. Such cooperation should exploit synergies in edge AI approaches for mobility 
and for CCAM, as well as its integration into the vehicle architecture.

Part 8 - Page 254 of 313 
Scope: Data sharing plays a pivotal role in supporting R&I, enabling deployment, and 
enhancing the competitiveness of the CCAM industry. Within the realm of data sharing, there 
are two distinct categories of data that are particularly pertinent: mobility data, and data for 
research and development. The common European mobility data space263 aims to facilitate 
mobility data access and sharing, and is supported by projects, notably from the Digital 
Europe Programme. This mobility data space will facilitate the sharing of data related to 
mobility patterns, traffic flow, and other macroscopic aspects that are essential for the 
development of CCAM solutions. Within the research, testing and deployment of CCAM 
solutions for the automotive as well as infrastructure sectors, there is a need for a dedicated 
data space tailored specifically to the requirements of CCAM stakeholders. This CCAM Data 
Space demands a more granular and extensive array of data to cater to the needs of both Tier 
X suppliers, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), traffic managers and infrastructure 
providers, particularly in terms of vehicle and traffic safety considerations. Specific aspects 
related to ongoing regulatory developments would need to be considered (e.g. Automated 
Driving Systems and General Safety regulations, adaption of type approval to the AI Act, 
including trustworthy AI integration). 
Several data spaces exist or are being developed in Europe for CCAM in specific R&I 
initiatives. The FAME264 project has released a CCAM Data Sharing Framework (DSF) 2.0 
describing best practices in data sharing and will develop a CCAM Federated Data Space as a 
proof of concept to facilitate the exchange of research and test data across R&I projects. 
Several CCAM Partnership R&I projects expressed interest in making data available and 
reusing data from other projects through the FAME Test Data Space, once it will be 
operational. The scenario-based validation approach for safety argumentation in highly 
automated functions will result in an integration of various scenario databases facilitated by a 
federated layer, as developed in project SUNRISE265 and SYNERGIES266. However, this 
integration falls short of constituting a comprehensive Data Space approach, both for new 
data sets and extensions of existing datasets. To achieve full Data Space functionality for 
CCAM, significant enhancements are required in terms of developing connectors, APIs, and 
protocols for seamless data exchange. Additionally, there is a need to refine user profile 
management systems and establish robust contractual frameworks to govern data access and 
usage rights. A generic data space blueprint and building blocks are being developed and 
governed by the Data Space Support Centre267. In parallel, the DeployEMDS268 builds a 
decentralised technical infrastructure and common governance mechanisms for urban 
mobility use cases in 9 cities and regions across Europe. 
Consequently, substantial efforts are necessary to fully integrate these approaches into a 
cohesive and efficient Data Space environment that can effectively support the diverse needs

of the CCAM research community and industry. Moreover, extensive datasets are also 
indispensable for the development of low-level modules such as driver monitoring systems, 
perception systems, and decision-making algorithms, as well as for sensors like GNSS, radar, 
cameras, and lidar. While projects like AIthena 269 and AWARE2ALL 270 have generated 
valuable datasets, the lack of centralised storage and access hampers their utility. Therefore, 
there is a strong need to incorporate such datasets into a unified CCAM Data Space that is 
aligned with the data space blueprint, taking advantage of the common building blocks.  
By establishing robust interfaces, ontologies, and data management architectures, the CCAM 
research community and industry can effectively utilise and repurpose existing data, thereby 
reducing costs, and facilitating the development and validation of CCAM solutions, including 
the creation of digital twins through synthetic data. The enhanced sharing of data across the 
CCAM stakeholders should also benefit national authorities, and operators in their efforts to 
collect KPIs to monitor wider impacts of CCAM solutions including on safety, economy, and 
society. 
Proposed actions for this topic are expected to address all of the following aspects: 
• Identify how to further evolve the data spaces for CCAM applications, connecting 
existing dataspaces and bridging data gaps; 
• Identify harmonisation and standardisation needs for taxonomies, interfaces, and data 
formats to push CCAM data exchange and extend and implement the CCAM taxonomies 
in the CCAM Test Data Space; 
• Identify information needs and reference data for KPIs collected from Member States 
and Associated Countries (where relevant and to the extent possible) of i.e. high-level 
socio-economic statistics, accidents, infrastructure, vehicles; 
• Establish a Federated CCAM Data Exchange Platform with tools and governance, 
including a viable business model to ensure the durability of the platform, which 
facilitates sharing of data for industry, social partners, authorities and academia that are 
supporting specific use cases related to: large-scale demonstrations, generation and 
maintenance of digital twins and representation of scenarios (for development or 
validation), performance and safety assessment, driver behaviour data from real and 
synthetic driving conditions, ADS regulation monitoring, AI model training, and 
common information source for national/EU level statistics and Key Performance 
Indicators; 
• Identify and describe methods/algorithms/processes to refine and use data for the 
specific use cases tackled by the Platform;

• Identify the effects of the EU General Data Protection Legislation (GDPR) on AI 
learning workflows and possible mitigation measures.   
A strong alignment with the common European mobility data space and related projects271 is 
expected. The work should ensure coherence and interoperability with other common 
European data spaces, especially regarding its cross-sectoral blueprint and building blocks, by 
aligning with the Data Spaces Support Centre and by using, as far as possible, the smart 
cloud-to-edge middleware platform Simpl272. The work should build on the outcomes of the 
FAME project and the FAME Test Data Space (Data Sharing - Connected Automated 
Driving). Finally, links with related activities under the future European Digital Infrastructure 
Consortium (EDIC) for Mobility and Logistics Data and cooperation with the CCAM 
Partnership’s States Representative Group (SRG) is expected. Particular attention should be 
dedicated towards establishing interoperability standards for data sharing within and across 
data ecosystems, through the implementation of the FAIR data principles and leveraging 
already adopted practices, especially in relevant European common data spaces. 
In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged in 
particular with Japan and the United States but also with other relevant strategic partners in 
third countries. 
This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Connected, Cooperative 
and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be 
expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Connected, Cooperative and 
Automated Mobility’ (CCAM) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs. 
Projects resulting from this topic are expected to apply the European Common Evaluation 
Methodology (EU-CEM) for CCAM273.

Activities are expected to achieve TRL 7 by the end of the project – see 
General Annex B. Activities may start at any TRL. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes: 
Demonstration of combined solutions for infrastructure construction that achieve the 
following targets: 
• At least 50% of the construction materials used are recycled or sourced from recycled 
materials; 
• Reduced pollutant emissions by at least 30% considering the entire life cycle of the 
infrastructure; 
• Reduced degradation of ecosystems and fragmentation of habitats during construction, 
maintenance, operation and decommissioning of transport infrastructure (thereby 
contributing to maintaining biodiversity); 
• Increased climate resilience of infrastructure to extreme weather and human caused 
events, assuring at least 80% capacity at network level during the disruptions; 
• Structured analysis and recommendations on the need for EU standards in construction, 
inspection, maintenance and deconstruction, contributing to the decarbonisation and 
increased resilience of transport infrastructure; 
• Guiding document on the necessary adaptations to public procurement rules that 
contribute to including clear sustainability and resilience award criteria.   
Scope: The overarching policy background is the European Grean Deal, which aims to 
achieve climate neutrality by 2050. In the transport area, this translates into a 90% reduction 
of transport-related greenhouse gas emissions by 2050274. To deliver the European Green 
Deal, there is a need to revise and upgrade numerous policies, including those for transport 
and large-scale infrastructures. 
The EU Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy275 (SSMS), which translates this overall 
transport target into actions, states that infrastructure must be adapted to climate change and 
made resilient to disasters. In line with the SSMS, it is also important that such infrastructure 
should rely on clean and decarbonised energy sources, notably renewable energy, as well as 
on a modernised grid.

Research in this topic should provide knowledge and technical solutions to a triple challenge: 
(1) limiting emissions of transport infrastructures; (2) making them more resilient to climate 
change; and (3) addressing environmental and biodiversity aspects. Projects should cover the 
entire life cycle of transport infrastructures, covering overall emissions from sourcing of 
materials, construction, maintenance, operation and decommissioning of the infrastructure. 
Proposals should address all of the following aspects: 
• Development of new methods and techniques to construct, manage, maintain and repair 
(including self-repair) transport infrastructures, in order to increase climate resilience 
and lower emissions; 
• Assessment of solutions considering the principles of circularity and taking into account 
the entire life cycle assessment (LCA) approach; 
• Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of the solutions considering the entire life cycle of the 
infrastructure and accompanying business plans for their implementation; 
• Application of innovative materials (e.g. green asphalt, green cement, carbon sinks) that 
enable transport infrastructures to become more resilient, more sustainable and emit less 
pollutants; 
• Validation of all the proposed solutions and proofs of concepts is to be carried out in at 
least two large-scale demonstrations. The demonstrations should cover at least two 
different transport infrastructure types (e.g., road, rail, waterborne, airport) which are 
located on at least two different Trans European Transport Network (TEN-T) corridors. 
The demonstrations should also cover different environments and phases of the 
infrastructure life cycle (e.g. design, construction, maintenance, decommissioning); 
• Analysis of EU national and international standards in construction, inspection, 
maintenance and deconstruction, contributing to the decarbonisation and increased 
resilience of transport infrastructure; 
• Design of green, sustainable and innovative public procurement methods, contributing to 
lowering the environmental footprint, resources, and material consumption; 
• Demonstration of sustainable and climate resilient infrastructure with nature-based 
solutions (NBS276), minimising the negative effects on the environment, including the 
degradation of ecosystems, the fragmentation of habitats and the loss of biodiversity.   
The projects should develop clear indicators with baselines and quantified targets in support 
of the expected outcomes that are monitored for each demonstration site. With regards to the 
expected outcomes, projects should take into account expected technological developments 
and policy implementation (e.g. revised TEN-T regulation), multi-disciplinary adaptive 
capacity in line with the European Climate Risk Assessment 277  (EUCRA) and the

 new use cases, solutions and applications, enabling harmonised electronic business-
to-business (B2B) information sharing and exchange in multimodal logistics chains 
and hubs such as those related to greenhouse gases (GHG) reporting, sustainability 
claims and other actions leveraging efficient and green freight operations in the 
supply chain;     
 complementary applications and services for electronic business-to-authority (B2A) 
information sharing aimed to support the implementation by businesses of relevant 
Union regulatory frameworks in transport or in other relevant policy fields, such as 
in the context of smart enforcement, statistics, customs, e-invoicing, sustainability 
reporting, data spaces, GHG and external costs calculators;    
• Best practices to boost and accelerate the adoption of eFTI framework and data sharing 
innovations by companies and in particular by SMEs are established; 
• Improved efficiency in operations and freight transport, through the provision of 
advanced digital connectivity and interoperability of the information shared 
electronically between actors in both B2B and B2A perspectives, compared to the 
baseline defined in the start of the project, is demonstrated and quantified;  
• Reduced administrative burden and costs associated with B2B data sharing and B2A 
regulatory and non-regulatory reporting are demonstrated and quantified.   
Scope: Electronic Freight Transport Information (eFTI) platforms established in line with 
Regulation 2020/1056 will play a central role in facilitating the implementation of business-
to-authority (B2A) information exchange processes related to multimodal transport of goods. 
In line with the Regulation’s requirements, common specifications for a single comprehensive 
data set and harmonised protocols for data sharing will ensure interoperability of the 
information shared electronically between actors, and the requirements for rights-based 
access-control system will establish safeguards for cybersecurity and trust. The use of 
electronic means to exchange regulatory information is also expected to reduce administrative 
costs for economic operators, to enhance the efficiency of freight transport services and to 
facilitate green transformation of the logistics sector. 
Therefore, given their potential, apart from specific B2A functionalities, eFTI platforms could 
also serve as an enabler for other universal, open and affordable solutions and tools to achieve 
digital interconnectivity of logistics systems and platforms including in a business-to-business 
(B2B) perspective. 
The proposals should unlock the potential of eFTI platforms for further functionalities, 
beyond the scope of Regulation 2020/1056, to new B2B services and applications as well as 
other B2A uses. 
Proposals should refer, as a core principle, to the legislative framework and specific 
technological solutions provided through Regulation 2020/1056, while duly reflecting the 
latest technological state of the art for electronic information exchange. Where relevant, and 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025

especially in B2B perspective, they should apply and build upon the concepts and solutions 
developed in other Union initiatives aimed to facilitate data sharing and exchange in transport, 
the Digital Transport and Logistics Forum (DTLF) and the European mobility data space 
(EMDS). 
Outside the scope of this topic is any type of architecture, federation of platforms or similar, 
as these are already delivered by eFTI and DTLF. Proposals also should not develop 
functionalities already required in the current scope of the eFTI Regulation. Instead, they are 
expected to leverage and/or extend functionalities of eFTI platforms that are in operation at 
the time of the implementation of the project, to ensure the effective implementation of new 
use cases. 
Building on the functionalities, requirements and implementation specifications for eFTI 
platforms provided for in the eFTI Regulation and its implementing and delegated acts, the 
proposals should address all of the following aspects: 
• Develop technical solutions and tools, at least at the level of operational prototype 
demonstration (TRL7), for complementary applications and services for electronic B2A 
information sharing; 
• Develop universal, open and affordable solutions and tools to enable electronic B2B 
information sharing in collaborative logistics processes. The proposed solutions should 
be implemented with minimal integration effort for industrial stakeholders, for instance 
through the usage of Artificial Intelligence to facilitate data and information 
interoperability. 
• Develop solutions and tools to facilitate SMEs engagement in the digital freight transport 
and logistics ecosystem and the adoption of solutions by SMEs. 
• Define multiple use cases, services and application of eFTI platforms for B2B and B2A 
processes duly accounting of relevant existing solutions and projects and identifying 
specific barriers to interoperability and universal adoption. 
• Identify and define relevant data to be added to the existing eFTI common dataset to 
support the new use cases, services and functionalities; while addressing aspects of data 
sovereignty, data privacy and cybersecurity, pursuant to the relevant Union legislation; 
• Assess and provide recommendations for B2B framework arrangements, including 
standard data exchange contracts, identification/authentication and authorisation to 
ensure trusted operations in data sharing and exchange in freight transport and logistics; 
• Define and seek synergies with relevant EU frameworks and policies related to the 
exchange of transport emissions data (such as new Commission’s proposal for the 
Regulation on CountEmissions EU 281 , the Corporate Sustainability Reporting

Directive282, and other relevant Union acts) to facilitate their effective and harmonised 
implementation, including through the establishment of an open source emissions 
calculators, as well as the exploitation of data sharing frameworks for carbon reporting 
between operators in the same supply chain; 
• Assess the interdependencies and needs with horizontal Union strategies and legislation 
such as GDPR283, digital identities284, data spaces285, AI act286, Data Governance Act287, 
Cybersecurity Act 288 ; identify best practices and provide recommendations for 
compliance.  
• Define and test B2A and B2B solutions and use cases in at least 2 demonstration 
environments/ecosystems involving platforms and users. B2B use cases should be led by 
industry stakeholders, in particular shippers and logistics service providers (e.g. freight 
forwarders, transportation companies). B2A use cases should be developed in 
cooperation with industry stakeholders, researchers and public administrations, including 
statistical offices. 
• Identify and develop best practices, map solutions and value streams. Provide 
recommendations on incentives, capability building, training and technology adoption 
support schemes as well as trust building mechanisms – to facilitate, encourage and 
accelerate the adoption of eFTI platforms and data sharing and exchange innovations by 
companies and in particular by SMEs.

Scope: Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transport represent around 25% of total man-
made GHG emissions and continue to grow. The negative impact of these is further 
strengthened by the existence of other external costs of transport, including air pollution, 
noise, congestion and accidents. The EU, Member States and industry have made 
considerable efforts to reduce transport-related GHG emissions and associated external costs. 
Accurate and reliable information on emissions is an important tool to increase effectiveness 
of specific emission reduction measures undertaken by public authorities and businesses. 
Over the past 15 years, a lot of progress has been made at EU level and globally through new 
regulatory actions and continuing collaboration between actors to improve the transparency of 
transport GHG emissions and external costs monitoring. This is manifested through: 
• Regulatory initiatives including Regulation (EU) 2023/1805 (FuelEU Maritime) 293 , 
Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 (ReFuelEU Aviation)294, Regulation (EU) 2015/757 (EU 
MRV)295 and especially, the recent Commission’s proposal for the Regulation on the 
accounting of greenhouse gas emissions of transport services (CountEmissions EU)296, 
and Directive (EU) 2023/2413 (Renewable Energy Directive); 
• Relevant EU research projects, including “Carbon Footprint of Freight Transport” 
(COFRET), “Logistics Emissions Accounting & Reduction Network” (LEARN) and the 
on-going “Creating Legitimate Emission Factors for Verified GHG Emission Reductions 
in Transport” (CLEVER)297; 
• Standardisation work, including ISO 14083, the official international standard developed 
between November 2019 and October 2022 and published in March 2023 as part of the 
14000 family of ISO GHG-related standards298; 
• Regular updates of the Handbook on the External Costs of Transport299; 
• Industry initiatives, such as the Global Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) 
Framework, the industry-led guideline for GHG calculation and reporting in the global 
logistics sector.

Building on the initiatives listed above, proposals should undertake further work to ensure 
that: 
• The full climate impact of transport operations is covered in a comprehensive and 
consistent way; 
• Relevant open items identified in the emissions accounting reference methodology set 
out under the Commission’s proposal on CountEmissions EU can be scientifically 
clarified and closed; 
• Any detailed tweaks to the methodology that have come to light through application can 
be developed and tested in view of the implementation of the CountEmissions EU 
framework; 
• New technologies, such as generative Artificial Intelligence, are considered in 
developing datasets and methodologies; 
• Relevant data is available for the proper implementation and seamless integration of 
requirements set in other EU climate related legislation in transport, including 
Regulations on Fuel EU Maritime, ReFuelEU Aviation, EU MRV, and Regulation (EU) 
2020/1056 on electronic freight transport information300.   
The Action will play a central role in contributing to the establishment of an unambiguous 
scientific framework aimed to tackle emissions in transport. However, the Action should also 
facilitate alignment between EU policy development and market implementation, especially 
towards enabling market-based accounting approaches that would support proactive 
investment in low emission fuels and associated transport services.  
The proposals should address all of the following aspects: 
• Explore, assess and establish the state of the art regarding issues of measuring and 
calculating specific types of transport-related emissions for which there is no clear 
consensus on the market, in particular:        
 black carbon emissions, which primarily result from the combustion of fossil fuels 
in compression ignition engines;     
 radiative forcing, which has been suggested as having a strong supplementary 
climate impact at high altitude and is already included in an inconsistent manner 
across some, but not all, transport GHG reporting programs;     
 GHG emissions from vehicle manufacturing and scrappage, which, although not 
directly linked to transport operations, do contribute to overall life cycle transport 
emissions;

 GHG emissions that result from the installation of transport infrastructure, which 
would need to include the definition of rules for the combination of operational and 
life cycle emission calculations into a meaningful and consistent presentation 
format;     
 GHG emissions related to the maintenance operations associated with transport 
operations that are currently excluded;     
 GHG emissions from information and communication technology (ICT) equipment 
and data servers that support the delivery of transport operations.    
• Clarify specific methodological issues for enabling more accurate quantification of 
emissions and setting proper incentives towards efficient and sustainable transport 
options, addressing in particular:        
 a detailed methodology for GHG emissions stemming from temperature-controlled 
transport and cool chain operations;     
 allocation of GHG air transport emissions across passengers and freight transported 
on the same aircraft.    
• Based on relevant European/national/sectorial repositories, explore, assess and 
contribute to an EU core dataset of default values for GHG emissions intensity of 
transport services, including for supporting relevant EU regulatory initiatives (such as 
CountEmissions EU); 
• Building on the results of the CLEVER project, where relevant, update the list of 
applicable GHG emission factors for emissions stemming from energy production, 
distribution and use, in particular in the context of relevant EU regulatory initiatives 
(such as CountEmissions EU). Consistency with data and methodologies in current 
energy legislation such as Directive (EU) 2023/2413 (Renewable Energy Directive)301 
must be ensured; 
• Define R&I gaps on emissions accounting of transport and provide scientifically sound 
recommendations to address those gaps to improve the existing GHG emissions 
measuring framework.   
The project’s main governance (e.g. Steering Group, Advisory Board) is expected to provide 
for direct involvement of all relevant stakeholders. 
Mechanisms to ensure coordination between other ongoing or selected projects (e.g. 
CLEVER) during their implementation should be put in place where applicable.

Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Enhanced solutions and tools to better integrate inland waterway transport (IWT) into 
the overall logistic chains and increase the modal share of inland waterway transport, are 
developed and demonstrated in use cases in line with the objectives set up in NAIADES 
III302; 
• Gains (compared to the baseline defined in the beginning of the project) in terms of 
operational efficiency, as well as environmental and social impact from the integration 
of IWT in multimodal logistics chains, are clearly identified, demonstrated and 
measured; 
• Recommendations for an EU regulatory framework on harmonised smart shipping at EU 
level, as well as input for related standardisation, harmonisation and amendments to 
Inland Water Transport Digitalisation Vision303 to reflect findings from the project; 
• Stakeholder engagement and communication campaigns and events to increase visibility 
and use of IWT are organised.   
Scope: While the increased use of sustainable transport modes and multimodal solutions are 
critical levers for transport, logistics and supply chain decarbonisation, and despite obvious 
environmental advantages, the modal share of the EU IWT sector has remained below 
expectations over the last decades. The seamless integration of inland waterway transport in 
multimodal supply chains requires the physical and digital connection to other land transport 
modes and maritime transport. Digitalisation is not a goal in itself but an important supporting

development required to remain competitive and to improve the connectivity to ports, other 
transport modes and the clients (e.g. to keep the direct costs low and to allow synchromodal 
solutions). Digital interconnectivity (with logistics systems and other digital platforms for 
transport) is crucial to increase the modal share of IWT in multimodal logistics chains and to 
be able to significantly contribute to the modal shift goals as presented in the Sustainable and 
Smart Mobility Strategy304. 
Proposals are expected to focus on the integration of smart vessels, smart infrastructure, smart 
data and smart governance in multimodal logistics chains. The proposals should address all of 
the following aspects: 
• Building on the results of previous and on-going Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe and 
Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) funded projects, identify, develop and test robust 
technical and operational solutions and tools (also exploring innovative technologies 
such as generative Artificial Intelligence) to connect physically and digitally IWT to 
existing land and waterborne multimodal logistics chains for a sustainable, efficient, 
safe, resilient, automated IWT with a view to synchromodal transport; 
• Define and develop key parts of the IWT-related aspects of a common framework for 
multi-modal data sharing, while enabling compatibility with legacy systems; building 
upon the concepts and solutions developed in other Union initiatives aimed to facilitate 
data sharing in transport, such as the Digital Transport and Logistics Forum (DTLF), the 
European mobility data space (EMDS), the electronic Freight Transport Information 
regulation; and considering high value datasets, the revised Intelligent Transport 
Systems (ITS) Directive305 and River Information Services (RIS) Directive. Outside of 
the scope are any type of new platforms or similar; rather, proposals are expected to 
leverage existing frameworks or platforms to ensure effective use case implementation 
(e.g. proposed solutions could interface with and be integrated in existing platforms used 
by shippers, carriers and freight forwarders to connect with multimodal information). 
Proposals could also identify datasets already available or that could be developed in 
order to enhance the integration of IWT in multimodal supply chains; 
• Define and test applications and use cases, building on the proposed solutions for 
advanced cooperative Smart Shipping and Smart Logistics, including integration with 
the physical infrastructure, in at least four demonstration pilots in actual operational 
environments (minimum at TRL 7). The pilots should focus on better integrating inland 
waterway transport in the multimodal supply chains, with a focus on cross border 
applications, on the accessibility and usability of node services in an automated/digital 
manner, and on efficient and green operations. The pilots should cover different types of 
goods, different routes and IWT basins (to have better EU geographical coverage), 
possibly along the Trans-European Transport Network corridors. To ensure a user and 
governance perspective approach, the pilot cases should be led by industry stakeholders

(e.g. freight forwarders, intermodal operators), in cooperation with shippers and public 
administrations (involvement of public administrations is considered a priority). The 
impact of increased automation and digitalisation on all stakeholders should be 
considered as part of the requirements definition and throughout the design life cycle; 
• Through the pilots and the application of the proposed solutions, analyse the existing 
relevant regional/national regulations, identify gaps and legal barriers, and propose 
recommendations for an EU regulatory framework on harmonised smart shipping at EU 
level, as well as input for the standardisation and harmonisation of the smart shipping 
components to the relevant standardisation bodies (e.g. CESNI, CEN, CENELEC); 
• Based on the pilots’ results, assess and quantify, in a comprehensive, structured and 
substantiated analysis, the environmental, economic and social benefits of smart 
shipping (including automated vessels and the link to the physical infrastructure), and 
the effects of increasing the use of IWT in multimodal logistics chains. Develop and 
propose new business models to incentivise the use of IWT; 
• Foster collaboration among key stakeholders, including transport operators, logistics 
providers, shippers, policymakers, and technology developers, also by implementing 
communication activities and organising an outreach event displaying the pilots’ results 
and the demonstrated advantages of integrating IWT in multimodal logistic chains.

Mobility Plans, etc.); 
• Advanced understanding and quantification of the value of IAM, its benefits and use 
cases, particularly in the urban logistics sector; 
• Enhanced multimodality, urban logistics planning/flow and communication between 
stakeholders, which can be replicated by other cities to enable IAM; 
• Creation of jobs and economic growth by implementation of urban air mobility services 
in the long-term; 
• Responsiveness to a deeper understanding of the needs and concerns of diverse social 
groups involved in or potentially affected by the R&I development, thereby increasing

Scope: The proposal is expected to develop the conditions and guidelines for a sustainable, 
smart, safe and resilient ecosystem for urban air mobility and services, focusing on the urban 
logistics sector, where drones could be more easily demonstrated and accepted than for 
passenger mobility. 
Proposals will have to address at least seven the following points: 
• Prepare a roadmap to define the needs for new or upgraded infrastructures and logistics, 
to facilitate innovation in IAM technologies and operations; 
• Collaborate with city authorities to develop guidelines for integrating and co-designing 
drone infrastructure, such as vertiports, landing areas, and charging stations, into 
Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans, ensuring environmental, safety, security, and privacy 
considerations; 
• Assess the effects of IAM traffic, including electric vertical take-off and landing 
(eVTOL) downwash/outwash308 on urban microclimate, as well as the requirements for a 
vertiport area, to enable safe IAM operations (incl. take-off and landing), for different 
VTOL aircraft and rotor configurations; 
• Building on EASA’s work and other studies on drone noise, assess and define the noise 
monitoring needs and tools that cities will have to implement, in areas where drone and 
IAM infrastructures and operations are planned, to ensure compliance with noise limits; 
• Analyse and make a proposal on how IAM could be integrated in the existing freight 
transport flows in cities, to boost multimodality; 
• Perform demonstration activities on IAM for cargo delivery (e.g. medical supplies), with 
data collection and flight monitoring between different landing/take-off areas/vertiports, 
while ensuring safety of operations in densely populated areas; 
• Evaluate and quantify the impact and potential benefits of cargo delivery by drones and 
eVTOLs on city congestion, noise, pollution, as well as on current and future airspace 
capacity to accommodate large scale operations; 
• Develop viable business models for sustainable IAM services for logistics operators, 
identifying key use cases where the benefits are the highest; 
• Collaborate with city authorities to align IAM services with citizen needs, developing 
strategies to raise public awareness and secure buy-in for drone integration. Identify 
attractive benefits and incentives for early adopters to accelerate market uptake of IAM 
operations and services;

Downwash is the downward flow of air produced by the propulsion system of an electric vertical take-
off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, such as the thrust from rotors. Outwash refers to the outward flow of 
the air that results from the downwash.

• Report on lessons learnt and recommendations to be shared with other cities for 
replication, and develop training / competence building packages for the relevant 
stakeholders (e.g., cities authorities involved in the design of a sustainable IAM 
ecosystem); 
• Analysis of potential rebound effects and arising questions of (energy) sufficiency with 
regard to extensive use and large-scale operations of IAM.  
Projects must involve cities authorities (multi-level governance) and logistics operators, to 
ensure user needs are duly considered. Projects should build on previously funded Horizon 
2020 projects such as AiRMOUR309. 
The action aims to exploit synergies with the EU Mission on Climate-Neutral and Smart 
Cities and with the SESAR 3 Joint Undertaking, while the alignment with the activities of 
EASA is highly recommended. 
This topic is a Societal-Readiness pilot: 
• Proposals should follow the instructions applying to the Societal readiness pilot, as 
described in the introduction of the Horizon Europe Main Work Programme 2025 for 
Climate, Energy and Mobility. They entail the use of an interdisciplinary approach to 
deepening consideration and responsiveness of research and innovation activities to 
societal needs and concerns. 
• This topic requires effective contribution of the relevant SSH expertise, including the 
involvement of SSH experts in the consortium, to meaningfully support Societal 
Readiness. Specifically, SSH expertise is expected to facilitate the socio-technological 
interface and enable the design of project objectives with Societal Readiness related 
activities.

development, thereby increasing the potential for beneficial societal uptake, and building 
trust in results and outcomes.   
Scope: The increasing automation of road transport is bringing up new challenges especially 
in lower automation levels (level 3 and below) when driving control is transitioning from the 
driver to the vehicle or vice versa. For these levels, ensuring the right level of driver vigilance 
with respect to the context and the automation level is important in order to avoid dangerous 
situations because of cognitive distraction. 
In addition, systems based on HTI are generally built on a non-stationary and non-
deterministic foundation – human behaviour. Therefore, the concept of individually 
“adaptive” systems has to be followed and elaborated in all its particular aspects, as the 
consideration of “average” human behaviour is not sufficient. 
This has large implications on the design of HTI systems. 
Such systems should provide a reliable and seamless interface between the driver and the 
vehicle in normal driving conditions as well as in specific situations with a risk of generating 
high cognitive load, diverted attention, inattention, impaired driving, or in the case of 
instantaneous limitations in driving capabilities. 
As drivers and their experience, as well as driving conditions, may vary a lot, HTI systems 
will need to address a wide variety of use cases in order to ensure a relevant Operational 
Design Domain (ODD)311. Therefore, in-cabin monitoring systems with adequate accuracy 
are key to have a clear understanding of the driver state, while considering all contextual 
in/out cabin data, so that the vehicle can propose a pertinent and tailored strategy to prompt 
the required driver action or behaviour. 
Advances in in-cabin monitoring and multi-modal sensing technologies, as well as robust 
detection/prediction of driver cognitive status adapted to the situation awareness, are 
necessary to achieve these objectives. The same applies to the need to link interior with 
exterior sensing capabilities. 
In addition, it is necessary to enhance drivers’ understanding of the assisted and automated 
driving system and to avoid mode confusion. In this aspect, the implications of automation on 
driver training and driver's licence requirements should be investigated. However, training 
methods for experienced drivers should also address the evolving technologies. This could 
include innovative training methods that prepare drivers for various mode transitions and 
safety critical scenarios like the development of virtual and mixed reality training approaches. 
The automation status and the limits of the system should be clearly communicated via the 
HTI to prevent mode confusion, enhance trust, and avoid unnecessary deactivation of the 
assistance or automation systems. 
Special attention should be dedicated to the “hand-over” and “take-over” phases. Hand-
over/take-over requests should be done considering the context (e.g. information from other

Results from the project of topic HORIZON-CL5-2023-D6-01-02 could be relevant for this issue.

vehicles or infrastructure) and the state of the driver in a way to minimise cognitive stress 
related to hand-over and take-over. In this context, it is important to investigate standardised 
requirements for the human-machine interface (including in case of system failure), including 
their assessment. 
In this respect, the proposals should focus on developing strategies to prevent driver 
disengagement and minimise cognitive load during critical situations. Additionally, 
behavioural models and methodologies should be created to identify activities or behaviours 
that the vehicle's human-machine interface (HMI) should avoid or block (such as 
entertainment systems that may distract the driver from driving tasks). These strategies should 
be scalable based on the sophistication of the vehicle's sensing capabilities. 
Moreover, proposals should address use cases involving specific populations, such as elderly 
drivers with decreased sensing abilities and higher sensitivity to cognitive load, young and 
inexperienced drivers, and professional drivers performing multiple tasks simultaneously. For 
these groups, a key question is how to meet their unique needs and how to balance tailored (or 
personalised) vs. standardised approaches for the best results. When considering these groups, 
proposals are expected to consider the gender dimension. 
Also, trust is mandatory for the acceptability of these systems: precision, reliability, and 
transparency need to be ensured. In particular, the vehicle response to a given situation as well 
as the level of information to be conveyed needs to be coherent and logical. Relevant research 
areas to achieve this objective will be the definition of multi-modal and multi-sensorial 
vehicle warning and response strategies for the safe management of critical phases 
considering user responsiveness and the severity of scenarios. 
HTI systems should be upgradable both in software and in hardware with minimal disruption 
for the users, while ensuring that the intended effect and functionality is improved or at least 
maintained. A cross-fertilisation opportunity would be to investigate how other transport 
modes (e.g. aviation) handle upgrades/updates with minimal disruption for the user.

• Improved (compared to the current figures for the locations selected for the pilot testing) 
road safety (actual and perceived) for pedestrians, cyclists, e-cyclists and users of other 
micro-mobility devices, considering that the safety of these users is not only at risk from 
motorised vehicles, but also from their interaction with road users with higher masses or 
operating speeds (e.g. between e-bikes and pedestrians); 
• An in-depth analysis and assessment of the safety associated with the emergence of 
electrically assisted small vehicles such e-bikes, e-cargo bikes, e-scooters, to be referred 
to as micromobility modes, that may be shared or own, and are used for personal 
mobility (e.g. commuting) and the transportation of goods (e.g. parcel delivery); 
• Increased (compared to the current figures for the locations selected for the pilot testing) 
use of active and micromobility modes in all age and socioeconomic groups as a result 
of improved safety; 
• Standardisation guidelines for the authorities (cities authorities, police, and hospitals) on 
how to report crashes that involve micromobility modes with the objective to avoid 
under- and/or misreporting; 
• Guidelines for the city authorities on how to incorporate micromobility modes in their 
Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs) and account for the safety and convenience 
of all road users; 
• Development of mitigating solutions for the adverse impact on the safety of cyclists, 
pedestrians, and other users of the changing car fleet towards bigger and heavier 
vehicles; 
• In depth analysis of the impact of road infrastructure (e.g. design, markings, degradation 
status, quality, network connectivity) on the safety and comfort of cyclists, pedestrians, 
and micromobility users and development of mitigation solutions; 
• Assessment methodologies to evaluate the safety potential and the effectiveness of 
advanced safety measures.   
Scope: The share of trips made by active modes is increasing, which is in line with the United 
Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This increase is linked to cities actively placing 
more focus on the mobility and safety needs of pedestrians, cyclists, e-cyclists and users of 
other micro-mobility device, which materialises in new regulations, and in new or improved 
infrastructure. However, pedestrians and cyclists remain heavily affected by crashes. 
Concurrently, the use of electrically assisted devices (such as e-bikes, e-scooters, e-cargo 
bikes, mobility systems used by people with disabilities, etc.) – to be referred to as 
micromobility modes – is increasing exponentially because these modes represent an efficient 
means of personal mobility, as well as a new and effective mode for the last-mile delivery of 
goods within the city area. Micromobility modes, shared and owned, have been adopted by 
commuters, tourists, the elderly, food and goods delivery companies, and come in varying 
sizes and operating speeds. When their use emerged, micromobility modes were associated 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 278 of 313 
with high hospitalisation rates, mainly for the micromobility users themselves, but also 
pedestrians and cyclists. While efforts have been made to regularise and standardise these 
vehicles, especially in the case of shared e-scooters, there is still a significant knowledge gap 
related to the operational safety of these vehicles in cities. 
Proposals submitted under this topic should address all of the following aspects: 
• Collect and use exposure data when analysing the safety of pedestrians, cyclists, and 
micromobility users, and identify crash contributing factors and their interactions; 
• Provide an extensive analysis of the safety needs, as well as tailored safety measures for 
cyclists and each type of micromobility mode (e.g. shared e-scooters versus owned e-
bikes), while taking into account the trip purpose (e.g. recreational ride versus delivery 
of goods), and the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the users; 
• Assess the actual and perceived safety risk of pedestrians and cyclists due to the 
emergence of micromobility modes that operate at higher speeds and that have increased 
in size and weight; 
• Quantify the impact of the geometric design, quality, and continuity of the cycling 
infrastructure on the safety of cyclists, pedestrians and micromobility users, considering 
their increasing demand, operating speeds, and size of vehicles; 
• Assess the potential effectiveness of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies in 
decreasing conflicts and near misses between pedestrians, cyclists and micromobility 
vehicles, and users and motorised vehicles; 
• Identify best practices in the design of bicycles and micromobility vehicles in terms of 
stability and the avoidance of single crashes, contributing to the underlying development 
of a draft European regulatory framework on the type-approval of micromobility 
vehicles or self-certification based on harmonised standards; 
• Identify, define and pilot test the following in at least two clearly identified real-life 
urban environments:         
 new geometric designs of infrastructure to ensure safe, seamless, and comfortable 
mobility for pedestrians, cyclists and users of micromobility modes while 
accounting for the increasing demand, higher operating speeds and weight and size 
of e-bikes, e-scooters and all types of micromobility devices;    
 smart technologies (V2X) to assess their effectiveness in preventing and decreasing 
conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists, micromobility modes users and motorised 
traffic;    
 road safety requisites, requirements, rules and/or regulations that could be put in 
place by local authorities in order to increase the take-up and the safety of active 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025

Part 8 - Page 279 of 313 
and micromobility modes in all age and socioeconomic groups, by 20% compared 
to the baseline at the start of the project;    
 development of a comprehensive, real-time information platform for cyclists that 
includes data on route accessibility, signage, and infrastructure conditions.   
Special focus should be paid to supporting the safety of user groups with particular 
vulnerability including people with disabilities (physical, mental, cognitive, developmental, 
intellectual, sensory, etc). 
Proposals are invited to explain how the work supports local/regional/national authorities’ 
efforts to deliver on the objectives of the Vision Zero Strategy, the Strategic Action Plan on 
Road Safety and the EU Road Safety Policy Framework 2021-2030 as well as on the 
integration of road safety policies and programmes in Sustainable Urban Mobility Planning. 
Proposals should plan for an active collaboration with the well-recognised initiatives in the 
field of road safety and urban mobility such as the European Road Safety Observatory and the 
CIVITAS initiative. In addition, proposals should demonstrate that the proposed approaches 
build upon the results from previous research actions314 and liaise and collaborate with the 
projects that will be selected under topic “HORIZON-MISS-2025-06-CIT-CANCER-01: 
Walking and cycling: increasing their modal share to reap health benefits and emission 
reductions and integrating active mobility and micro-mobility devices, with smart 
technologies and infrastructure”. 
This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) 
disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts and institutions, as well as the inclusion of 
relevant SSH expertise, to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal 
impact of the related research activities, with a focus on human-technology interaction, 
responsiveness of safety solutions and how this varies across different population groups, and 
behavioural norms.

Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Knowledge of high-risk locations along the road network becoming available, before 
crashes actually occur, enabling road authorities to deploy appropriate countermeasures 
proactively; 
• Predictive identification of safety-critical situations based on data from multiple sources 
and enabling real-time interventions to avoid crashes; 
• Determination of the optimal sample size to allow for reliable real-time crash occurrence 
prediction; 
• Enhanced monitoring of traffic flows and incorporation of traffic flow variations and 
patterns in real-time crash prediction, which will also lead to more effective traffic 
management by foreseeing unexpected or disruptive events.   
Scope: One of the principles of the Safe System Approach is to turn from mainly re-active to 
pro-active management of road safety, i.e. not to derive needs for intervention primarily from 
crash investigations, but to intervene before serious crashes happen. The ubiquitous gathering 
of ever-growing amounts of data and their processing in the digital transport system support 
this idea providing valuable information on traffic situations and events. Potential data 
sources include amongst others: smart phones, wearables, connected vehicles, drones, road-

side sensors (e.g. camera, radar), etc. Progress in computing power, in the accuracy of 
location services and in video analytics are further enablers in the processing and analysis of 
such data in order to identify safety-critical situations or conflicts based on surrogate safety 
metrics. 
In terms of crash prediction modelling artificial intelligence has the potential to identify the 
underlying risk and the complex relationships between large and diverse datasets which in 
turn could lead to the identification of crash contributing factors and their interrelations. The 
identification of these risk factors may then allow predicting safety-critical situations at 
quantifiable risk levels and guide the proactive implementation of crash avoidance measures, 
as proposed amongst others by the International Transport Forum at the Organisation for 
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Ideally, interventions would be feasible 
in real-time and increase the safety of all road users. 
Proposals should address all the following aspects: 
• Development of an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled digital twin of traffic and 
infrastructure. This would integrate historical, current, and forecast data, including 
crowdsourcing and infrastructure sensors, infrastructure topology and condition, along 
with environmental (e.g. local weather and visibility) and road and traffic conditions. 
Such a digital twin can allow monitoring and preventively optimising both safety and 
traffic flow, equally addressing congestion and resilience issues. Results from existing 
projects like OMICRON316 could be considered. The proposals should also explore the 
possibility and usefulness of other type of data such as sociodemographic and economic 
data, behavioural driving data, data from security cameras, among others that could be 
provided by third parties (tourism, planned events, demand, etc.); 
• Analyse in detail the technical challenges associated with the acquisition and use of 
adequate and reliable big data from multiple sensors in the road transport system, as well 
as the process of combining these datasets in ways that are meaningful for proactive road 
safety analysis; 
• Develop methods and tools to predict safety-critical traffic situations at quantifiable risk 
levels based on real-time and historical data; 
• Account for biases in the datasets and ensure that the developed AI-based models or 
algorithms are bias-free, so that the safety of all road users will be improved effectively 
in a fair, non-discriminatory way; 
• Analyse in detail also the non-technical challenges associated with this approach and the 
inherent need to collect and share large amounts of data that can be used to identify and 
quantify road safety-related risk factors. Ethical, legal and economic issues should be 
considered and concepts be developed to overcome these challenges in terms of privacy 
concerns, questions of data ownership, organisational barriers etc;

• Analyse what real-time countermeasures can be taken to reduce instantaneous risk levels 
for all road users complementary to existing Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) 
services; 
• Demonstrate the feasibility of such risk predictions and targeted interventions; 
• Build consensus among relevant stakeholders on possible routes for deployment in 
coordination with other ITS services.  
Particular attention should be dedicated on establishing interoperability standards for data 
sharing, through the implementation of the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and 
Reusable) data principles and leveraging on already adopted practices especially those in the 
relevant Common European data spaces. 
Ways to leverage valuable complementary data, e.g. metadata from crash databases, should 
also be explored, as well as links to initiatives for European data spaces. 
Research is expected to develop recommendations for updates to relevant standards and legal 
frameworks. International cooperation is advised, in particular with projects or partners from 
the US, Japan, Singapore and Australia. Knowledge and experience from other modes where 
similar approaches are followed in much more controlled environments should be leveraged.

Expected Outcome: The need to perform research in the field of icing, to ensuring safety and 
efficiency of proposed new solutions (TRL 3-5), is justified by the increasing incidence of 
weather hazards caused by climate change, the new generation of low carbon dioxide (CO2) 
aircraft with associated disruptive configurations, and the stringency of new policies and 
certification rules. 
In the mid-term, project results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:  
• Generating scientific expertise to develop means of compliance for the certification of 
icing systems; 
• Generating scientific knowledge to be able to develop new prototypes of ice detection 
and protection.   
Scope: The field of aircraft icing is of particular importance because it relates to the safety of 
flight facing adverse weather conditions, which became increasingly extreme during the last 
decade. 
The aviation industry is working to develop clean and sustainable aviation. There is the need 
to innovate while maintaining safety. 
To enable design, validation and future certification of new technologies emerging from 
cleaner aviation, R&I should be initiated on the following three principal areas ( proposals 
should consider addressing all, or significant areas of all, three areas): 
1. R&I to prepare for the development of means of compliance for certification of future 
sustainable aviation concepts including: 
• Development of reliable numerical tools to be used to validate the designs against the 
icing environment of Appendix C, O, P and snow, including ground anti-icing fluids; 
• Development of Supercooled Large Drop (SLD) Testing Capabilities such as icing wind 
tunnel test or ice tankers. Generation of flight-testing open datasets for validation of 
modelling and tunnel testing; 
• Development of European Ice Crystal test Capability (for engine/air data probe); 
• Development of Falling / Blowing Snow Testing Capability.   
2. R&I on Icing environment to assess the impact of the climate change effects on the 
certification icing environments318.

3. R&I related to new technologies for Ice detection and protection, including: 
• Ice crystal and SLDs Ice Detection systems to optimise Ice crystals protection or support 
the detect and exit the SLD appendix O or a portion of the appendix O conditions; 
• High Efficiency/Low Energy protection: cleaner aviation with more electric airplanes 
will drive the need for new ice protection technology: more effective and with less 
energy, active, passive and hybrid technologies (e.g., low ice-adhesion durable coatings 
and including new air mobility products (e.g., low speed propeller icing concerns); 
• Dissimilar means for Air data (angle of attack (AOA)/Speed) measurement and 
insensitive to icing threat. Air speed and aircraft attitude measurements are crucial for 
aircraft control. Air data/navigation probes are externally mounted and exposed to 
adverse conditions. Dissimilar means to determine the aircraft speed and altitude would 
provide benefits and make the air data system even more robust and fault tolerant to 
environmental conditions (icing or hail); 
• Enhanced aircraft performance and in particular ice protection health monitoring by 
improving the ice protection system monitoring coverage based on smart systems 
capable to monitor a large number of aircraft parameters.   
This research and innovation topic is linked to several ongoing rulemaking actions of the 
European Union Aviation Safety Agency:   
1. RES.0010 Ice Crystal Detection 
2. RES.0017 Icing hazard linked to super cooled large droplets (SLD) 
3. RES.0014 Air-data enhanced fault detection and diagnosis 
4. RMT.0196 Update of the flight simulation training device requirements 
5. RMT.0118 Analysis of on-ground wing contamination effect on take-off performance 
degradation   
A close cooperation with the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and with 
notational aviation authorities during the implementation of this project should be envisioned. 
 
318 
Note: the project will assess the use of specific models for the prediction of icing conditions (e.g., 
addressing cloud micro-physics for the formation ice crystals, super cooled water droplets), which can 
be coupled to climate models (e.g., General Circulation Models).

Grants to identified beneficiaries 
1. Support to European Standardisation Organisations for the development of an 
improved test method for heat pumps 
Expected impacts: 
This action is necessary and urgent for the EU to be able to use this improved test method in a 
regulatory context. If this new test method is adopted without asserting the identified 
knowledge gaps, problem may appear after the new test method has been adopted leading to 
problems in the enforcement of heat pump ecodesign and energy labelling regulations. 
Without this action, stakeholders are likely to remain undecided on the test method to be used 
with the risk of paralysing the regulatory process. 
Expected outcomes: 
This grant will be awarded to legal entities identified below as it follows up this previous 
work within the CEN TC113/WG8 in which knowledge gaps were identified. Indeed, before 
this new test method can be implemented by the EU in a regulatory context, it must be 
ensured that it is representative (shows realistic performance compared to real life), 
reproducible and repeatable. In that direction, a Round Robin Test is necessary to validate the 
method. It is also necessary to identify product subtypes whose control configuration or other 
characteristics would make it impossible to test with this method. 
Scope: 
Heat pumping is a key technology for the future of heating in the building sector: heat pumps 
will supply a sizeable share of the heat to satisfy building needs in the future. Energy 
efficiency is a key parameter for the uptake of heat pumps and it will also influence future 
energy demand for heating of buildings. Heat pump energy efficiency is regulated through 
ecodesign (Regulation (EU) n°813/2013) and energy labelling (Regulation (EU) n°811/2013) 
regulations. Harmonised standards, which are reliable, accurate, reproducible, and 
representative of real-life use are important for product energy efficiency regulations to be 
applied and enforced. In the context of the revision of the previously mentioned regulations, 
discussions are on-going to improve the present test method. With the present test method, the 
average energy efficiency (calculated in standard EN14825) is obtained by weighting the 
results of steady state tests obtained by setting the unit control in specific modes following 
manufacturer instructions (according test method defined in EN14511-3); it means that the 
impact of the control of the unit on the energy efficiency is not fully considered and that it 
cannot be ensured that the set points tested are really part of the normal functioning of the 
machine. In order to improve the situation, a new and dynamic methodology has been

Whereas the Montreal Protocol has been successful in reducing the release of ozone depleting 
substances, unexpected increases in emissions, for instance linked to uses in chemical 
processes, have been recorded through atmospheric sampling. Parties to the Montreal Protocol 
have asked the scientific community to identify gaps in global coverage of atmospheric 
monitoring of controlled substances under the Montreal Protocol and to provide options on 
ways to enhance such monitoring. 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 288 of 313 
Their decision320 tasks the Multilateral Fund of the Protocol (MLF) to develop a funding 
modality enhancing atmospheric monitoring, guided by the scientific advice of the Advisory 
Committee of the General Trust Fund for Financing Activities on Research and Systematic 
Observations Relevant to the Vienna Convention (VCGTF). 
The action should support the international efforts on the identification and characterisation of 
sources of emissions of controlled substances and their local abundance, providing data for 
subsequent optimisation of measurements of the ozone-depleting substances and F-gases, 
which may include satellite-based measurements. The latter is challenging due to the very low 
concentrations of the relevant substances in the atmosphere (parts per billion to parts per 
trillion).  
A grant to UNEP, managing the VCGTF, should strengthen the global monitoring network by 
providing support for the establishment of additional monitoring capacities at locations that 
need to be identified. The identification of suitable locations for measurements requires 
complex modelling of atmospheric circulation patterns and subsequent measurements at 
potential sites. The envisaged financial support through the MLF would ensure a long-term 
operation of additional monitoring capacities, enabled by this grant.  
The action will identify potential emission sources and pathways, which are not yet fully 
understood, including how they are released and how they can be best monitored via 
atmospheric sampling.  
The action will support, in at least 3 different locations, in-situ measurements for at least 2 
consecutive years. The locations should cover different regions at a global scale that are 
identified as representing a gap in atmospheric monitoring. The action should also provide 
support for calibrating new and existing monitoring capacities, to reinforce international 
networks.  
The action should build on the scientific findings presented in this context to the Parties of the 
Montreal Protocol, including through the “Report of Scientific Assessment Panel to the 11th 
Meeting of the Ozone Research managers – White Paper - Identification of gaps in the global 
coverage of atmospheric monitoring of controlled substances and options to enhance such 
monitoring (2021)” and outcomes of the “Workshop on Costs of atmospheric Monitoring of 
Gases Controlled under the Montreal Protocol (February 2024)”, and the EU-funded project 
operated by the UNEP Ozone Secretariat on ‘Regional quantification of emissions of 
substances controlled under the Montreal Protocol’.

Prizes 
1. Renewable energy technology (RET) solutions in energy communities 
Individual energy communities encounter different challenges, such as developing a 
successful governance structure that is sufficiently inclusive and involves different types of 
actors, carrying out an effective business model and embedding activities within the structure 
and management of the European Commission to territorial regional and/or local plans (e.g., 
Just Transition Plans, Climate City Contracts, etc.).  
By rewarding Energy Communities’ innovative governance structure and management of a 
RET, the prize aims to inspire other Energy Communities to improve their operations and 
implementation activities and to foster innovativeness in the compliance of climate goals. In 
addition, this prize will also serve as inspiration and example to other types of communities to 
become an energy one, accelerating the pace for the ones that are already being 
formed/developed.  
The prize will showcase the best practices from the awarded communities to other ones 
experiencing similar challenges and issues, portraying a (replicable) framework on how to 
address these issues successfully. In this way, communities will feel incentivised to apply 
these practices, to improve their performance, management, etc., and so they can participate 
in future (similar) prize calls. 
Since Energy Communities have encountered bottlenecks in terms of management, 
governance structure, provision of other services, etc., this prize will aid to portray the 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 290 of 313 
successful ones on how to develop/carry out a fruitful business model that includes and 
promotes different type of services, while including and improving social aspects within the 
community. 
While showcasing governance innovativeness within the common barriers encountered to 
operate, the awarded communities will present a clear example that can serve as a replicable 
framework for other communities on how to overcome challenges and barriers, and address 
encountered common bottlenecks. 
Furthermore, the prize is expected to contribute to the broader goals of the EU Mission on 
Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by demonstrating how energy communities can play a 
pivotal role in achieving climate neutrality at the city level. By embedding their activities 
within existing strategic and systematic approaches towards climate neutrality, such as the 
Climate City Contracts, these communities will help cities transition to more sustainable and 
resilient urban environments. 
The total money allocated to this prize is €1 million (EUR 1.000.000) to be awarded up to 10 
winners as follows: 
• 1st place: €350.000 
• 2nd place: €200.000 
• 3rd place: €100.000 
• 4th place to tenth place: €50.000   
Essential award criteria: Prizes will be awarded, after closure of the contest, to the applicants 
that in the opinion of the Jury demonstrates excellence within their governance structure in 
the following criteria:   
1. Inclusivity of the governance structure: Addressing the issues of gender balance, 
membership diversity and solution to inequalities 
2. Internal governance processes: Covering the aspects of innovative financing, 
mechanisms for representative governance, members participation and engagement with 
local authorities 
3. Regional/local approach: links into territorial plans, activities related to regional policies 
4. Other innovative approaches; efforts to integrate the energy community to the broader 
energy system, alignment with local sustainable energy and climate action plans or other 
relevant environmental related plans and cost saving initiatives.  
Eligibility criteria: The contest will be open to all Energy Communities that fall into the 
definitions and concepts of the Energy Communities Repository, which identifies renewable 
Energy Communities and Citizen Energy Communities as defined in the Renewable Energy 
Directive and in the Internal Electricity Market Directive. Under EU law, energy communities

2. Industrial Carbon Management knowledge sharing platform 
A growing number of carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) projects are on track to 
become operational before 2030. The Communication on Industrial Carbon Management324 
emphasises the importance of aggregating these industrial-scale projects into a knowledge-
sharing platform to facilitate the collection of and information on best practices between 
CCUS projects in the EU. This procurement is expected to establish and operate an open 
collaboration and knowledge sharing platform, providing data and up-to-date information 
about the entire CCUS sector, based on the collection of primary data from current and future 
large-scale demonstration projects. 
The knowledge sharing platform will be open to all projects (at industrial scale, but also larger 
research and pilot demonstrations) that are ready to share information and cooperate without 
disclosing commercially sensitive information and in full compliance with single market 
competition rules. Depending on the type of project, the knowledge sharing platform must 
collect and display data on deployed technologies and storage site characteristics as well as 
best practices from the projects, such as project governance (including management of 
interphases and risks, involvement of operating organisation of facility 325), barriers and 
success factors, needs for standards, access to funding, stakeholder management, regulatory 
aspects and permitting issues. It will also cover lessons learned on public engagement and on 
sharing best practice of dialogues between project developers, local and national authorities. 
The data and information must be displayed in a user-friendly way in order to be easily 
accessed by industry stakeholders, managing authorities, policymakers, researchers and 
citizens.

6. Support to cities to enable deployment of innovative sustainable air mobility services 
The Urban Mobility Framework, adopted in December 2021, recognises Urban Air Mobility 
(UAM) as an emerging transport and mobility service. Several barriers remain to ensure an 
uptake of this new mode of transport, e.g., the preparation of cities and local authorities. This 
action is intended to support cities in their endeavour to introduce Innovative Aerial Services 
(IAS) in line with the goals of the Drone Strategy 2.0326: 
• Number of cities/regions that will be served by IAM regular commercial services (Target 
for 2030: at least 45 in the EU and at least one per Member State) 
• Number of Member States where emergency health services (medical samples, 
defibrillators, air ambulances) will be provided using drones (Target: services used in at 
least 20 Member States)  
This action intends to: 
• Prepare cities for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) to become a part future urban multimodal 
intelligent mobility ecosystem; 
• Increase societal acceptance of new IAM services.

Indirectly managed actions 
1. Contribution to InvestEU blending operation under the Green Transition product 
The ‘Fit for 55’ package of measures adopted by the Commission in July 2021 sets out the 
policies and legislation for the EU to meet its 2030 target of 55% net greenhouse gas 
emissions reductions, which will create new opportunities for investment in new technologies 
and approaches. The final aim is decarbonising the economy in line with the objectives of the 
Paris Agreement, the European Green Deal and the European Union’s 2050 net-zero target, 
and Climate Law. That is why the European Commission intends to establish an efficient 
framework to identify European projects deploying innovative technologies, business models 
and approaches to reduce the green premium – the difference between the price of a carbon-
emitting technology and its clean alternative. Under existing initiatives, the Commission has 
already been supporting, under InnovFin and other EU programmes, a variety of 
technological pathways for decarbonisation. InnovFin Energy Demonstration Projects327, in 
particular, has been very effective at mobilising finance for first-of-a-kind projects in the area 
of innovative renewable energy production, storage and smart grids. It has mobilised so far 
EUR 346 million of EU support for 11 operations (with total project costs of EUR 864 
million). 
The blending operation will target projects at TRLs 6-8 via the European Investment Bank 
(EIB) or other implementing partners’ financial instruments, by providing loans and quasi-
equity (or a combination of both), which may be blended with non-reimbursable components. 
The financial instrument component of operations may draw from the Innovation Fund, this 
Horizon Europe action, or the InvestEU budget, while the non-reimbursable component will 
only be funded by this Horizon Europe action – to be spent economically as a last resort 
option to enable project’s financial closure. 
The blending under the InvestEU’s Green Transition product focusses on the following four 
areas that are underrepresented in the current portfolio of InnovFin: 
• Renewable hydrogen. In July 2020, the Commission adopted the Hydrogen Strategy328 
with the aim of decarbonising its production and to expand its use to store, transport and 
accelerate the use of renewable energy, as well as replacing fossil fuels in specific 
sectors, aiming to reach 40 GW of electrolyser capacity by 2030, producing up to 10 
million tonnes of renewable hydrogen. Investments in renewable hydrogen production 
capacity are estimated at EUR 180-470 billion in the EU until 2050. The strategy 
identifies as a clear priority the production of renewable hydrogen, i.e. hydrogen 
produced through electrolysis using renewable electricity. In this context, a top priority 
is to demonstrate larger size, more efficient and cost-effective electrolysers, with 
capacities reaching 100 MW and above. Another priority is to further develop large scale 
hydrogen end-use applications, notably in industry. The path to business case feasibility 
(without any grant component) of the solution at potential replication sites shall also be

investigated. The necessary coordination, along the value chain with the European Clean 
Hydrogen Alliance329, and on data and knowledge with the observatory and data base in 
the Clean Hydrogen Joint Undertaking, is foreseen. 
• Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). Though aviation accounted for only 3.7% of total CO2 
emissions in the EU in 2018, it accounted for 15.7% of CO2 transport emissions. 
Reducing aviation emissions is challenging considering the long operational life of 
aircraft and the fact that that zero-emission aircraft configurations and powertrain 
options for commercial air transport are far from technological and commercial maturity. 
SAF can significantly reduce aviation reliance on fossil fuels, while relying on existing 
infrastructure and propulsion systems, but the transition will require significant 
investments. While several SAF production pathways are certified, their use in the fuel 
mix is still very low due to high production costs. The price of the most innovative and 
sustainable types of fuels is on average estimated at up to 3 to 6 times the price of fossil 
aviation fuels depending on the production pathway, while their lifecycle emissions 
savings are 85% or more compared to fossil fuels. The path to business case feasibility 
(without any grant component) of the solutions at potential replication sites shall also be 
investigated as well as sustainability in wider scale as part of the Fit-for-55 package. The 
EU has therefore adopted the ReFuelEU Aviation330 to boost the supply and use of 
sustainable aviation fuels in the EU. The action will support the development of the most 
innovative SAF notably advanced biofuels and RFNBOs331 in line with the ReFuelEU 
Aviation and Renewable Energy Directive sustainability framework. 
• Long duration energy storage (LDES). At any moment in time, electricity consumption 
and generation have to be perfectly matched. This balance is necessary not only in the 
short term for power grid stabilisation (for which short duration storage solutions exist), 
but also over the long term, to ensure supply adequacy, by compensating for 
fluctuations, for meteorological dark and still periods (‘dunkelflaute’) that can last a few 
weeks, and for seasonal variations between summer and winter. Long duration – weekly 
to seasonal - renewable grid scale energy storage needs will expand as both the 
electrification of demand and the share of renewable – and variable as well as distributed 
- energy sources in the total supply mix will grow. Sustainable long duration energy 
storage therefore has a key role to play in the transition towards a carbon-neutral 
economy. The storage system needs to be optimised for large capacity and long duration 
(weekly, seasonal), for minimal climate and environmental footprint over the full life 
cycle, for regulatory compliance and for financial viability (hence maximising round trip 
efficiency, minimising costs and identifying a business case for the targeted investment 
based on electricity storing / de-stocking price projections). The path to business case 
feasibility (without any grant component) of the storage solution at potential replication 
sites shall also be investigated. Sustainable storage solutions for renewable energy, 
involving an energy vector that can be used for other purposes than regenerating

electricity are also eligible. The topic is open to all technologies: chemical (including 
hydrogen and its derivatives), electrochemical, thermal and mechanical technologies 
(other than pumped hydro which is mature and available commercially). 
• Direct air capture (DAC) of CO2. European Commission scenarios reaching net-zero 
emission by 2050 show extensive use of carbon dioxide removal, including DAC. For 
example, the 1.5 tech scenario forecasts 266 Mt of CO₂ point capture and 200 Mt of CO₂ 
DAC. Most IPCC scenarios modelling 1.5°C paths also include a share of carbon 
dioxide removal (with and without DAC). DAC emerges as the most relevant source of 
carbon for renewable power-to-fuels/chemicals processes in such scenarios, but several 
challenges remain for a large-scale deployment of the technology. The future operational 
and financial viability (without any grant component or support scheme) of any DAC 
solution at potential replication sites shall also be investigated in function of the fate of 
the captured CO2 (i.e. underground storage or use), renewable energy source used for 
the capture process, and vicinity to CO2 transport and storage infrastructure (in case of 
underground storage). The International Energy Agency estimates the current DAC cost 
to be within a wide range of $100-$1000 per captured tonne of CO₂. Stakeholders claim 
that costs can be reduced to €50-€100 by 2030 with sufficient investments in R&I and 
deployment. As there is so far no specific EU initiative targeting DAC, this topic will fill 
an important gap. 
• Decarbonisation of Industry (steel and cement). Rapid innovation is needed to bring to 
market clean technologies for those parts of the energy system where emissions are 
harder to address, in particular carbon intensive industries (e.g. steel, cement, chemicals, 
aluminium, ceramics). Carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) will play an 
important role in mitigating those hard-to-abate process emissions. In March 2023 the 
European Commission introduced the Net Zero Industry Act, which identifies CCUS as 
a strategic net zero technology for which scaling up of manufacturing capacity is critical 
to reaching the EU’s climate goals. Specifically, the Act proposes to set an EU-wide goal 
to achieve an annual CO2 injection capacity of 50 Mt by 2030, with oil and gas 
producers asked to contribute, in addition to setting clear timelines for permitting CCUS 
projects. While CCUS technologies have been demonstrated in various settings and on 
certain scales, it is still a challenge to scale up these technologies for widespread use, 
understand their performance and requirements and develop the best models for their 
deployment. This is due to factors such as energy efficiency, cost of capture 
technologies, and the technical feasibility of transporting and storing large volumes of 
CO2.  
Functioning of the blending operation agreement 
The blending operation will be open to all applicants meeting the set eligibility criteria set in 
this text and InvestEU Green Transition product. As such, it is not restricted to projects 
proposed under pre-existing or future partnerships with the European Commission. This 
blending operation is particularly relevant because it seeks to bring together the public and 
private sector to fund pre-commercial, industry-scale demonstration projects for critical 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 298 of 313 
decarbonisation technologies, directly addressing the early deployment funding gap for the 
selected technologies and provide a structure to accelerate their commercialisation. 
Projects’ selection and financing procedure follows the InvestEU Regulation. In particular, 
the EIB or other implementing partners will check the financial viability of and perform full 
due diligence on each potential financing operation, while the Commission services assure 
their eligibility under the ‘policy check’ procedure. Special attention shall be paid to ensuring 
that the technologies developed, and Intellectual Property generated will benefit the EU 
interest, in particular by focussing the funds on high quality projects realised in the Union/ 
eligible Associated Countries. 
Expected impact 
Unprecedented investment is needed to turn climate policy targets into reality. Attaining the 
2030 target of at least 55% net emissions reduction is estimated to require EUR 350 billion of 
additional annual investment. Blended finance is a crucial tool to mobilise urgently needed 
private ‘patient capital,’ especially in domains considered too risky for the markets to 
function. This is the case of the technologies selected, which will benefit from investments in 
demonstration and scaling-up – leading to increased confidence among market participants, 
economies of scale in production and deployment, and significant cost reductions. The project 
pipeline of the InnovFin EDP and FutureMobility facility, as well as the high number of 
submitted proposals under the first Innovation Fund calls, indicate the richness of the EU 
ecosystem, which - boosted by the Fit-for-55 package - is expected to thrive in the coming 
years. The initiative will accelerate the reduction of the green premium in key areas, allow for 
wider, faster up-take and contribute to the creation of jobs in the EU in green industries 
manufacturing these solutions.

2. Voluntary contribution to the IEA’s Clean Energy Transitions Programme (CETP) 
The International Energy Agency's (IEA) Clean Energy Transitions Programme (CETP) turns 
targets into action, working to accelerate progress towards the goal of global net zero 
emissions through secure and people-centred clean energy transitions, with a focus on major 
emerging and developing economies. Drawing on the IEA’s recognised expertise, this 
programme assists the target countries in overcoming the energy technology and policy 
challenges of moving towards the implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement. In 2022, at 

Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2025 
Climate, Energy and Mobility 
Part 8 - Page 299 of 313 
the IEA's Ministerial Meeting, 15 IEA member countries and the European Commission 
expressed their support to the CETP, with the goal of accelerating the global transition to net 
zero emissions. 
The CETP delivers collaborative action across three areas: 1. Accelerating national transitions 
(supporting emerging and developing economies to develop and implement timely strategies 
for achieving national clean energy transition goals); 2. Strengthening multilateral 
coordination (facilitating international collaboration to scale up innovation and deployment of 
clean energy sources and technologies); 3. Informing global energy dialogue (developing 
greater international understanding of barriers and environmentally sustainable solutions for 
the development and deployment of clean energy technologies). 
This Contribution Agreement will be awarded to the legal entity identified below as it 
contributes directly and significantly to the external dimension of the EU Green Deal and the 
Paris Climate Agreement and can leverage IEA’s unique clean energy expertise and 
recognition in major emerging economies. 
Scope 
The new three-year CETP project will build on the outcomes of the previous and current 
CETP activities funded by the European Union. It will deepen and extend work in at least 
three of the following areas: (1) reducing investment risk and improving the cost of capital 
and financing options in priority countries; (2) strengthening the global landscape of clean 
energy innovation; (3) expanding analysis and modelling to empower policymakers, 
regulators and system operators in priority countries with regard to clean energy policy design 
and implementation; (4) strengthening the quality and accessibility of official government 
data and statistics. Additional activities can be developed in response to changes in the global 
clean energy landscape. 
The involvement of the European Commission, including its delegations in priority countries, 
should be sought throughout the implementation of the project as appropriate. 
The project duration is expected to be 3 years.

5. Voluntary contribution to the Mission Innovation Secretariat, hosted by the 
International Energy Agency 
Mission Innovation is a global platform bringing together 23 countries and the European 
Commission (on behalf of the EU), launched at COP21 in 2015, with the aim to accelerate 
efforts in clean energy globally. Its goal is to both stimulate political action and attract 
investments on research, demonstration, and development to make clean energy technologies 
more attractive, affordable, and accessible to all. 
Mission Innovation (MI) is entirely voluntary, a free commitment of countries, international 
organizations and industry, that are all welcome to collaborate and provide support to its 
workstreams according to their own strategic priorities. MI members represent over 95% of 
global government investments in clean energy research and innovation. 
In 2021, MI has reached the end of its first phase of five years, in which its members have 
successfully stimulated global efforts, increasing annual investments by more than USD 5.8 
billion and developing over 70 new international collaborations (worth USD 1.4 billion) in 
clean energy through joint calls, demonstration projects, and student and researcher 
exchanges. If 1000 innovations delivered by MI members were fully deployed, they could 
avoid emission of over 12 Gigatons of CO2 per year until 2030. 
MI 2.0, launched in June 2021, concentrates on seven impact-oriented, public-private 
missions, with ambitious goals that accelerate the pathway towards the Paris Agreement goals 
and net zero. Namely they focus on: clean hydrogen, urban transitions, zero-emission 
shipping, net-zero industries, green power, integrated biorefineries and carbon dioxide 
removal. 
The Commission currently plays a key leadership role in Mission Innovation, by (co-) leading 
two missions, through its contribution to the governance of Mission Innovation and by 
delivering the Chair of the MI Steering Committee. 
As of September 2025, the Secretariat of Mission Innovation will be hosted by the 
International Energy Agency. While continuing to be a member driven initiative, the 
allocation of the Secretariat to the IEA will allow the multilateral platform to receive financial 
contributions from its Member States. At the MI Steering Committee meeting on 30 October 
2024, Members have expressed their support to the new Hosting arrangement and provided 
indication of financial commitment to the Mission Innovation Secretariat.

4. Advancing of the TEN-T alternative fuels infrastructure analyses to support research 
and policy 
Detailed, timely and reliable information on the progression from research to deployment is 
essential for further research, evidence-based policy and decision making. In particular, with 
the adoption of the ‘Fit for 55’ package, including the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure 
Regulation (AFIR), the revised TEN-T regulation and other relevant initiatives, information 
on alternative fuels infrastructure deployment and identified gaps in the transport network is 
crucial to monitor and to support the uptake of innovative solutions for sustainable transport. 
Enhanced mapping and data visualisation of the alternative fuels infrastructure network can 
also facilitate investments in research and innovation by private stakeholders. Valuable 
information is becoming increasingly available, for instance through the European Alternative 
Fuels Observatory (EAFO) and the analyses performed in TENtec. However, additional data 
and analyses are needed to develop and enhance comprehensive algorithms that consider 
routing, and perform an in-depth, comprehensive assessment of alternative fuels network

tools for detecting structural deficiencies of bridges and tunnels in the TEN-T network 
Bridges and tunnels in the TEN-T network present structural deficiencies or are reaching the 
end of their design life. Ensuring that our transport system is truly resilient against future 
crises and climate events is a key objective of EU’s transport policy. The project will 
categorise the TEN-T tunnels and bridges according to their state (e.g. very good, good, 
mediocre, bad, very bad) and develop tools to prioritise expensive interventions, in a general 
situation of tight budgets and supporting administrations in planning and decision-making. 
The project will valorise research output on infrastructure management and maintenance 
(making sense of data, methods and deployment in practice), as well as identify and 
streamline future research, align with sector needs, avoid duplication and target application.
